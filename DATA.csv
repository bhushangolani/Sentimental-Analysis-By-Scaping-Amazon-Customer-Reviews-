Name: 0, dtype: object","[""I bought this phone because I wasn't willing to spend a grand on the S20/ or note. Plus on Amazon it saved me an extra 100. I have tmobile. And I switched my sim out from my S9. Phone calls and texting worked immediately but it took me a couple hours to get the mobile data running. But after I restarted the network I am now on 5G.\nI did not receive my headset. I reached out to Amazon and I'll see what they say. If not I'll reach out to Samsung. This phone is larger than my S9 but I love the screen size even though it's not easy to hold for me with one hand. It is a beautiful phone. Screen has amazing color. And it is quite fast. Downer is the battery life. I've been on it for a couple hours and I'm down to 62% but it did charge really fast. From what I did see of the camera in low light the picture did come out nice for being at night. 3 different settings are on upon opening it. Zoom back, regular and zoom in. I'll see what the pictures look like in the day. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. Just hope that the battery life gets fixed. It's a nice alternative for getting a new phone at a not so large price tag.""]"

Name: 0, dtype: object","[""This phone is a lot better than expected. Coming from the s10+, I was worried that I would be completely disappointed. The s20fe feels premium despite having a plastic back. This is due to its thickness and weight. The plastic feels premium and the cloud mint doesn't leave visible fingerprints. The phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865; the phone feels very smooth. The 120hz refresh rate also adds to the smoothness of the experience. 6gb of ram is sufficient for the vast majority of users. My s10+ plus had 8gb and I felt like I could have an endless amount of apps open. The same could be said with this phone. The cameras are quite good but I'd recommend testing out the phone in person. Yes... the 1080p display looks fine. You will not be able to tell the difference unless you get a magnifying glass or put your eye right up to the display. If you are coming from the s8 or and older phone, this phone is worth picking up.""]"

That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.\n\nThe phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.\n\nDoesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.\n\nI'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5.""]"

Name: 0, dtype: object","[""Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.\n\nThe only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.""]"

Name: 1, dtype: object","['I honestly don\'t know why these aren\'t more popular. Let\'s be real here, this is a very, very good ""economy"" phone that rivals midgrade phones. Sure your higher end phones have metal casings, water resistance/proof, fingerprint scanner, but for those that can do without it\'s a crazy good steal. Seriously. $65. Brand new. Unlocked. You can\'t beat it. Even the low $100 models aren\'t even better, spec wise. It comes with a case and screen protector, which is easily a $20 value. Case in point, these are great for basic employee/kid/elderly phones. You can buy 15 of these for the same amount as any new $1000 phone, not be locked to a carrier, and don\'t sweat it if you lose it or it gets stolen. I wish they had aftermarket cases though, ha.']"

Name: 1, dtype: object","['I have always used budget phones and the last Blu phone I had was the HD R1 that lasted over 16 months as my Daily phone till I dropped it the wrong way, with a case, and shattered the screen. I got an email from Blu about this model and was intrigued by the features and spec. All of Blu’s other lower end phones suck because of their specs but this one would fit the bill. I got this phone for my 9 year old son. Unfortunately he’s still in the learning stages of how to be responsible for things and broke the last Older iPhone we gave him while roller skating outside. I call this type of phone a disposable phone cause of the cost. if it breaks, it was only $60, replace it with another. Build quality is pretty good, the 3000mah battery life is awesome and lasts for days. My son has Roblox and a few games on it, he doesn’t complain that it’s slow. We also added a parent link app to where we control his screen time which is cool. Remember the price people !! Don’t give a bad review trying to compare this to a flagship phone cause it’s not !! Some complain about not having a selection of cases, duh !! It’s Blu and even other small name brand companies do NOT offer a case but be lucky Blu gives you a free one in the box with the phone !! For now it’s working well. I may just buy a couple more and have them in inventory cause they are so cheap and if one breaks, replace it. Thanks Blu for making a great replacement for the HD R1. It’s a good design with good specs.']"

Name: 5, dtype: object","[""I bought this phone for my younger brother, who has been an Umidigi user for more than five years and was in the ned of a cheap, yet trustable device. This phone served this purpose and surprised us with an incredible camera set up.\n\nPros:\n\n- Price: In this market, getting a $169.99 phone + 2-day shipping (if you are a prime user) + Stock android + great set of cameras = Fantastic\n\n- Screen: Despite my dislike of the bottom chin, the screen quality it's great. Very bright, fluid, and QHD. Yes, you read it right, QHD. Tell me a phone at this price range with something that it is not Full HD? Exactly, just this one.\n\n- Battery life: Using youtube + phone calls + messaging + WiFi + Data = I got 32% at the end my day (around 10 PM). Like any other phone, you will charge it at the end of the day to have it ready.\n\n- Headphone jack: Look, I love my Bluetooth headset. But when it comes to audio quality, there's nothing better than to be 'old school' and plug your headphones. With this feature disappearing, having the option is great.\n\n- Expandable storage: Despite the 128GB internal memory setup, you can spend $20 to get 128 GB more through SD. Cheap, reliable, and easy fix.\n\n- 2 SIM cards: You can use up to two SIM cards on the same phone. I don't use this feature, but I know some of you may like it.\n\n- Unlocked + Global 4G VoLTE bands: In short, you can use this phone with any carrier that uses a SIM card in the world. Also, since T-mobile is now switching to phones that are 4G VoLTE capable only (sorry 3G phones), this phone will work.\n\n- Cons (only one):\n\n- RAM: Despite the ram is the second-to-last generation available in the market (top of the line phones are now using the LPPDRX5), it's fast and reliable. However, the only negative point to me is that it has only 4 GB of ram. My brother, who is coming from an Umidigi phone he bought 5 YEARS AGO, has 6 GB of ram. I think this is the only weak spot on this phone. However, if you don't have 20 apps running in the background, the new android manager (pre-installed in Android 10) will do magic with this ram amount, and you won't even feel a difference with phones that have 6 or 8 GB.\n\nSummary: A great mid-range phone, with great cameras, and unbeatable price.\n\n(If you made it to the end, thank you for time)""]"

Will it perform well in your everyday tasks that most users need a smartphone for - absolutely!\nAfter using the phone for a few days I was pleasantly suprised by just how will it performed for all but the most processor intensive games.\nFirst impressions are extremely important and can make or break your opinion of a device which is why I wanted to include a couple of pictures that show just how much attention to detail and thoughtfullness was put into that all important first impression.\nFrom the little outer sleeve, to the thank you card, through the notes on the front and back screen protectors, and ending with the script on the sleeve containing the little quick start guide and sim extraction tool are all classy.\nNote that both a case and screen protector are pre-installed on the phone.\nOnce you remove the case you get a glimpse at the beautiful finish on the back of the phone, blue is the color I picked and boy does it ever shine and shimmer in the light. Really nice job. Also on the back is the four camera module housed in a rectangular bump. Again I'd like to point out the attention to detail here with the layout and something as seemingly simple as the font and color used for the text, and making the flash element look like a light strip.\nI'm 'color blind' so I can't comment on the color accuracy of the photos I've taken but they are, in my opinion, quite good as far as subject reproduction.\nThe addition of a macro and wide angle lenses make a difference and aid in getting just the right shot.\nThere were two OTA updates available from UMIDIGI which I installed - now, that may seem normal, but what wasn't was that there was a description of what bugs were addressed and features that would be added.\nAnother pleasant surprise was that there was no bloatware installed - only a subset of Google apps that most people would install anyway.\nUMIGIDI has gone very light with the skinning of Android which no doubt helps keep the performance of the device up, especially when combined with 4GB of RAM and 128G of storage space (which is expandable). Little helpful touches like having the choice to turn off alerts for turning off the screen or plugging in the charger are a welcome addition. The fingerprint reader on the back is as fast and accurate as ant other I've used. The screen is bright and easy to read.\nBattery life has been impressive, I got the phone Sunday afternoon and even after the rigours of setting up a new device, installing all of the software and updates, and getting everything configured the way you want it, I still had 20% remaining as I write this on Tuesday evening.\nAs stated in my description, this phone may be inexpensive, but the combination of build quality and feature set make it perform far above the price you've paid for it.\nYou will not be disappointed if you decide to purchase this device as long as you are not a hard core gamer.""]"

They've packed so much cool useful features on this budget phone when I first saw they had the new A7 Pro here on Amazon I went for it, glad I did!\n\nIt's good to look online and see the videos with information on this phone, the specs are everything I wanted, 128 memory with the option to add more if you wanted. Also able to have two sim cards on this phone I can see this being great for people who travel a lot.\n\nOnce I unpackaged it from the box in hand this isn't any light flimsy phone, it's a tad heavier than my S8. Personally, I like this as it doesn't feel cheap or easy to break during a fall.\n\nAnother thing I rarely see is the A7 Pro came with a beautiful case as well as a factory screen protector which is a huge difference as this is the first thing I do when I get a new phone is to protect it. They have packed so much into this phone for SUCH A LITTLE PRICE!\n\nType C charging it's the modern way to charge new devices its nice to see they went with type c charging. In the box, they have included both charging cable & charging block. With a BEAST of a battery 4150mAh goodbye to having to charge my phone every night as it stays charged for close to two days!\n\nTo me, this is a huge upgrade from my Galaxy S8 to this Umidigi A7 Pro so this must say something.\nEven with the Quad camera in the back will allow you to take some very cool snapshots & Videos.\nWith the front-facing 16MP resolution Selfie camera.\n\nI was super excited to get this it's now my daily phone, it's well worth the small price tag as you get some much with this phone. Hope this helps with your purchase.\n\n××EDIT××\nSuch a great phone buying another 64GB A7 Pro for my youngest daughter, the appearance of the phone, in general, is beautiful. For $199.99 it's a steal. Even has a biometrics finger printer scanner.\nRunning the current Android 10. It may be a tad slow as it has one of the older chips. It's nothing noticeable. They've packed so much into this budget device and I am a total fan. Just bought another one thank-you!""]"

I was looking at the UMIDIGI brands and researched them for a bit to find out that they are the new beginning of flagship killers. All the UMIDIGI phones are packed with good first or secondary choice hardware, and has capabilities of a top-notch flagship killer.\n\nThis phone was fast, aesthetic, good build, durable. Specific specs that I liked about this phone would be the dual SIM card slot (because not many phones have dual SIM\'s *cough* flagship), extra storage (comes with MicroSD card slot), the beautiful 6.3"" full HD screen, long battery life of 4150mAh, and not much or any bloatware (which means it doesn\'t come with many apps on first startup). It comes with a case which is great and lastly, it has ""decent"" speakers. I wouldn\'t say they\'re above average, but they do produce a great and loud sound. It lacks bass though.\n\nCons, for the price you\'re paying, you\'re expected to have some sacrifice like the camera. If you\'re a really keen and hard user for cameras, I do not suggest you buy this phone. It will take average pictures and the settings and aperture adjustments aren\'t very good. Otherwise, if you just wanna capture memories on an ""average"" camera, then yeah this phone would be good.\n\nOverall, for the price, you get what you paid for. That\'s my experience with it. I\'m happy I bought it for my friend and he loves it as well as me.']"

Name: 7, dtype: object","['Affordable smarthphone with premium features, this is the model you want for sure!\n\nPROS\nIf you don\'t know the features of this phone, you can do a quick search on the Internet. It\'s the successor to the Redmi Note 8 pro, and it\'s even better smartphone. It has more battery, faster charge 30W, better processor, sideprint reader. Like the previous version, it has an NFC chip, which is an advantage over other models such as the Xiaomi 9S in a phone with similar features and price. It is also a phone that has been on the market for only 2 or 3 months, therefore, it uses the latest technology.\n\nThe phone comes with a printed multi-language manual (English-Spanish included and many others).\n\nTransparent dark-rubber case included.\n\nDual sim and Micro Sd tray that you can use at the same time. In the previous version (note 8 pro) one of the sim use the space of the micro sd or vice versa.\n\nCONS\nThe only thing is the European charger. It\'s fully functional in the USA but the adapter that the seller includes for free is needed. If you don\'t want to use an adapter, you will have to buy a 30w USB-c charger.\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION FOR NORTHAMERICA\nIt works great with metro by t-mobile or GMS carriers. But remember, only the GLOBAL VERSION with model number M2003J6B2G works well in the USA. NON-GLOBAL or ""International non-global version"" such as CN version for China or India markets, will give you many problems to use them with LTE 4G in the USA.\n\nMY SHOPPING EXPERIENCE\nMy Xiaomi Note 9 Pro 128gb/6gb (Interestellar Gray) Global Version was sold by Mobiles International LLC through Amazon. There are many sellers, but I can assure that they sent me the Global Model perfectly closed in the original sealed box. I live in NC and this GLOBAL VERSION connects by LTE 4G to very good speed and full network signal. Of course, I can call or send sms too without any problem.\n\nThe phone arrived 2 days before the indicated date, perfectly wrapped with original sealed box.\n\nIMPORTANT ABOUT CONFIGURATION\nI didn\'t have to reconfigure APN or anything on the phone but it\'s very important to perform the following step with your carrier:\n\nYou need to assign this new smartphone to your SIM card. For that, I called to my carrier metropcs at 611 number or Customer Service 1-888-8metro8 (863-8768). After verified my user profile, they assigned the IMEI parameters of this phone to my SIM card / phone number (You can see the IMEI number on a label attached to the phone). In only 5 minutes I was using the internet at LTE 4G speed without any problem. Again, If you don\'t asign the IMEI with your carrier on your account, the phone doesn\'t find signal. This is not a phone problem, this is a necessary carrier configuration with every phone you want to asign to your phone number or SIM card.\n\nAnd that\'s all. I have been using the smartphone for several days and I am very happy with it. I hope this review helps you and resolves all questions regarding this great smartphone. Good luck and stay save!']"

Name: 10, dtype: object","[""When I received this phone, I was pretty sure that I would like it very much. So I immediately inserted my T-Mobile sim card, but I could not use the network data. I immediately contacted with Ulefone customer service, they were very friendly and provided me with help, telling me how to input the APN, and finally solved the problem successfully. I am very satisfied with their services.\n \nThe phone looks really beautiful, with a 6.52-inch screen. The screen quality is good. The body is thin and light, holding it makes me feel comfortable. It has texture and good for gripping it on. The battery is great, I rarely have to charge it during the day and I'm a heavy user.\n \nI do not expect high-quality photos but it does give me good quality photos. Much better than other budget phones. The macro camera is good, it can takes really beautiful photos. When using macro, you should ensure that the distance between the camera and the object is close enough, otherwise you will not be able to get the effect you want.\n \nPerformance is good. So far it doesn't seem sluggish after I installed all my apps.\nOverall it is a fantastic phone in this price range. Good value for money. Worth to buy it.""]"

The fingerprint recognition doesn't work and I can never sign into the phone without putting the PIN code in.\nI do use my phone for live broadcasting oh, that is my second job, and now because of my phone camera not working I can't do it.

The selfie camera is very good going from my s9+, and the rear cameras are about on par with that phone in day light, however in low light there is lots of noise. Good enough for sharing pics on social media, but probably not if you want to get your photos printed.\n\nWhat was very strange is that the SD card that came with the phone was just loose in a case and is not branded or in any sort of packaging... not sure if its been used.

The battery was decently charged when we powered on the phone. The phone started up quickly and moved very well. I was apprehensive about the Android Go Edition, but it feels just like any other Android build. The screen is vibrant and the sound is decent. Downloading apps is very straightforward as with other Android devices. I ran into an issue where the Play Store got hung up, so I killed it through the Phone Settings > Apps > Google Play Store > Storage > Clear Data. Once I started the app again, it ran just fine. One unfortunate thing: I found out that the Wi-Fi card unfortunately isn't dual band (doesn't support 5 GHz Wi-Fi band).\n\nThe layout of the phone is a little strange, but it doesn't render the phone unusable. Both micro USB and AUX port are on the top of the phone. Volume and lock buttons are both to the right of the screen. Popping off the back cover involves sliding a fingernail or card through the slit near the front side of the phone (which is never mentioned in the instructions).\n\nI hope it lasts my girlfriend at least a year.

Name: 19, dtype: object","[""I bought this phone for my younger brother, who has been an Umidigi user for more than five years and was in the ned of a cheap, yet trustable device. This phone served this purpose and surprised us with an incredible camera set up.\n\nPros:\n\n- Price: In this market, getting a $169.99 phone + 2-day shipping (if you are a prime user) + Stock android + great set of cameras = Fantastic\n\n- Screen: Despite my dislike of the bottom chin, the screen quality it's great. Very bright, fluid, and QHD. Yes, you read it right, QHD. Tell me a phone at this price range with something that it is not Full HD? Exactly, just this one.\n\n- Battery life: Using youtube + phone calls + messaging + WiFi + Data = I got 32% at the end my day (around 10 PM). Like any other phone, you will charge it at the end of the day to have it ready.\n\n- Headphone jack: Look, I love my Bluetooth headset. But when it comes to audio quality, there's nothing better than to be 'old school' and plug your headphones. With this feature disappearing, having the option is great.\n\n- Expandable storage: Despite the 128GB internal memory setup, you can spend $20 to get 128 GB more through SD. Cheap, reliable, and easy fix.\n\n- 2 SIM cards: You can use up to two SIM cards on the same phone. I don't use this feature, but I know some of you may like it.\n\n- Unlocked + Global 4G VoLTE bands: In short, you can use this phone with any carrier that uses a SIM card in the world. Also, since T-mobile is now switching to phones that are 4G VoLTE capable only (sorry 3G phones), this phone will work.\n\n- Cons (only one):\n\n- RAM: Despite the ram is the second-to-last generation available in the market (top of the line phones are now using the LPPDRX5), it's fast and reliable. However, the only negative point to me is that it has only 4 GB of ram. My brother, who is coming from an Umidigi phone he bought 5 YEARS AGO, has 6 GB of ram. I think this is the only weak spot on this phone. However, if you don't have 20 apps running in the background, the new android manager (pre-installed in Android 10) will do magic with this ram amount, and you won't even feel a difference with phones that have 6 or 8 GB.\n\nSummary: A great mid-range phone, with great cameras, and unbeatable price.\n\n(If you made it to the end, thank you for time)""]"

Name: 19, dtype: object","[""Let's get the question on everybody's mind out of the way first: Will the UMIDIGI A7 Pro perform as well as a top-tier flagship smartphone from other OEM's - no. Will it perform well in your everyday tasks that most users need a smartphone for - absolutely!\nAfter using the phone for a few days I was pleasantly suprised by just how will it performed for all but the most processor intensive games.\nFirst impressions are extremely important and can make or break your opinion of a device which is why I wanted to include a couple of pictures that show just how much attention to detail and thoughtfullness was put into that all important first impression.\nFrom the little outer sleeve, to the thank you card, through the notes on the front and back screen protectors, and ending with the script on the sleeve containing the little quick start guide and sim extraction tool are all classy.\nNote that both a case and screen protector are pre-installed on the phone.\nOnce you remove the case you get a glimpse at the beautiful finish on the back of the phone, blue is the color I picked and boy does it ever shine and shimmer in the light. Really nice job. Also on the back is the four camera module housed in a rectangular bump. Again I'd like to point out the attention to detail here with the layout and something as seemingly simple as the font and color used for the text, and making the flash element look like a light strip.\nI'm 'color blind' so I can't comment on the color accuracy of the photos I've taken but they are, in my opinion, quite good as far as subject reproduction.\nThe addition of a macro and wide angle lenses make a difference and aid in getting just the right shot.\nThere were two OTA updates available from UMIDIGI which I installed - now, that may seem normal, but what wasn't was that there was a description of what bugs were addressed and features that would be added.\nAnother pleasant surprise was that there was no bloatware installed - only a subset of Google apps that most people would install anyway.\nUMIGIDI has gone very light with the skinning of Android which no doubt helps keep the performance of the device up, especially when combined with 4GB of RAM and 128G of storage space (which is expandable). Little helpful touches like having the choice to turn off alerts for turning off the screen or plugging in the charger are a welcome addition. The fingerprint reader on the back is as fast and accurate as ant other I've used. The screen is bright and easy to read.\nBattery life has been impressive, I got the phone Sunday afternoon and even after the rigours of setting up a new device, installing all of the software and updates, and getting everything configured the way you want it, I still had 20% remaining as I write this on Tuesday evening.\nAs stated in my description, this phone may be inexpensive, but the combination of build quality and feature set make it perform far above the price you've paid for it.\nYou will not be disappointed if you decide to purchase this device as long as you are not a hard core gamer.""]"

Also able to have two sim cards on this phone I can see this being great for people who travel a lot.\n\nOnce I unpackaged it from the box in hand this isn't any light flimsy phone, it's a tad heavier than my S8. Personally, I like this as it doesn't feel cheap or easy to break during a fall.\n\nAnother thing I rarely see is the A7 Pro came with a beautiful case as well as a factory screen protector which is a huge difference as this is the first thing I do when I get a new phone is to protect it.

All the UMIDIGI phones are packed with good first or secondary choice hardware, and has capabilities of a top-notch flagship killer.\n\nThis phone was fast, aesthetic, good build, durable. Specific specs that I liked about this phone would be the dual SIM card slot (because not many phones have dual SIM\'s *cough* flagship), extra storage (comes with MicroSD card slot), the beautiful 6.3"" full HD screen, long battery life of 4150mAh, and not much or any bloatware (which means it doesn\'t come with many apps on first startup). It comes with a case which is great and lastly, it has ""decent"" speakers. I wouldn\'t say they\'re above average, but they do produce a great and loud sound.

So let me get into the review as what I currently like or don't like:\n\nPros:\n1. Very nice design and features for the cost\n2. Customer Service response is fast\n3. Device has a Macro camera that is VERY useful for viewing small text/items\n4. Device comes with protection for screen and phone\n5. It compliments well against much higher priced brands (We know who they Are).\n6. It has very helpful features such as the Dark Theme, Night light setting and other helpful features\n7. It is very Fast with the 64bit processor.\n8. It fits nicely in the user's hand (However, I would prefer square sides fro better holding).\n9. Battery lasts a good while, and it charges very quickly.\n10. It offers very good camera settings and options\n11. I love the option to kill apps quickly and the option to slide left or up for maneuvering if like.\n12. Very easy navigation\n\nCons:\n1. General camera only allows 4x zoom.. (My brother made me look bad with his Samsung on the zoom).\n2. Speaker Sound is a bit distorted at loud volume and not very loud.\n3. Round curved edges makes slipping out of hands more probable but most companies use this crazy design.\n4. Fingerprint recognition is OK, but sometimes I have to do it 3 times\n5. Light on camera only active as a flash.. (I prefer in some settings to have the light constantly on)\n\nConclusion:\nFor the cost this phone offers very good comparison features to more expensive brands. I really notice the 64bit speed. The screen is a bit long and narrow, however, it fits good in the hand. For all purposes for what i normally use a cell phone for, Talking, text, taking notes, recording, Internet, etc.. This phone does the job.\n\nI all so have the Ulefone X5, it is Very Nice!, however, I am waiting to get my hands on the Rugged X8 when released.\n\nUlefone, for my opinion, has done a very nice job for the price in comparison to other major brands..

The Note 9P\'s only noticeable drawbacks from the G8 Power are its temperamental thumb reader (regarding both sensitivity and response time), the battery size is a hair smaller, there\'s no native gesture functionality, and, of course, there\'s the lack of any prestigious-sounding, widely-U.S.-known, branding (but, hey, ""image"" can mean a great deal to some folk 🤣 ... 🙋).\n\nBUT, just you never mind those things--they amount to a small price paid for the gains that I\'ve experienced (and that you\'ll experience too!) since choosing the uleFone Note 9P as my next phone.

Not only did the phone ship for a sliver under 200, it came with a case that is definitely to my satisfaction, it also came with a screen protector. I personally wasn't a fan of the blue colour for protector because I found it made my picture look off actual colour. With all the money I saved I had no issues buying one online. For 7 bucks. So. Battery life beyond expected, size was at par and speed was also beyond what I expected. In my opinion I think it's better than the pixel 2 that I put aside because battery was draining way faster than it did when bought.

Cause even the battery saver doesn't work. You can't turn it on when you want to. If you plug it in to charge it the battery saver turns off.

The Nokia 9 Pureview was decent, but camera operation was too slow, and I felt that it didn\'t justify the $400+ price tag. Still on the hunt, I decided to take a chance with an Umidigi phone, as my experience with my Umudigi Smartwatch was good for what I wanted in a smartwatch. With so many Umidigi phones on Amazon\'s site, decided on the F1 for the battery and the 128GB storage, with the ability to add more storage with a microSD card. The 6.3 inch screen is very clear, and just as responsive. Even with the near stock Android 9 Pie experience, I still like my Microsoft Launcher, as it has a few more abilities, such as resizing the icons, and to have numbered badges on the icons for waiting notifications. Such as unread emails/text messages. The camera is a bit off, but if you are willing to work with the camera, it will work for you in turning out more than just decent pics. Not as good as Samsung or iPhone, but much better than I had expected for the price. Battery life is very good, as it can last more than a day and a half in my case, as I use constantly use my phone. Would last way more for the casual user. Not into games as much, but haven\'t had an app crash or struggle with the F1. The fingerprint reader, face recognition aren\'t 100%, but what is. When it works, it is fast to unlock. However, both of them working together to back each other up, and with the PIN/Pattern to unlock, you\'ll get to your phone no problem. Besides, fingerprint scanner on the F1 is much better than that of the Nokia 9. I get all my text, phone calls clear, no issues there at all. Of course, cell reception may vary based of location. Being unlocked, can use it on any GSM network (ATT/T-Mobile).\nWas looking for a tempered glass screen protector, and the ones offering for the F1....not so well, as they just dont align or fit or ""stick"" as well. Mainly having the protector not adhere to the edges, giving off that \'gap\' between screen and glass. Looked around and took a chance on one meant for the Samsung M20.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PD14Q9L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nGuess what, it fits, and fits along the edges, now looking like it belongs with the Umidigi F1, not just the Samsung M20. Looking for a tempered glass for your F1, please consider one for the M20.\nThat\'s all I got for now. Will update if i run into any issues in the future.\n\nBTW: 3.5mm headphone jack?!?!? Genius!!! :) As much as all my Bluetooth devices works on my F1, still love a good headphone jack.']"

Google's camera app will not work with this phone. I found an amazing open source camera app on Play store that used the lenses, but they were very unstable on this phone, and I ended up just using they stock app despite its limitations. A minor drawback is the absence of variety for a phone case (none of the indestructable cases are made for this), and the one accompanying the camera it is next to worthless. My real problem was the fact that a couple of weeks in, I woke up one morning after leaving the phone running my noise app and alarm clock beside my bed, found the phone turned off, and it would not turn back on. Black screen. I had failed to notice when I place my order for the camera that it did not have an optional extended warranty available, which I had intended to buy since this camera has no warranty beyond the 30-day Amazon return period. I elected to return it, and Amazon was prepared to immediately ship me a replacement, but with no warranty and that unreliability, I was unprepared to take another chance, and opted for a refund.

This has the latest Android, has a headphone jack (very important to me so I don\'t keep frying my brain with wireless buds), has a micro SD card slot, it has Gorilla Glass, has a really good speaker, an excellent fingerprint reader in the perfect position and the MOTO software is excellent. The phone has pop up help messages at just the right times as you transition so switching phones is easy. How many flagship phones can last 18 hours with heavy usage? Oh, it also has fast charging (usb-C). Charged from 59% to full in about an hour. So, get this and laugh at the idiots spending 6x more for having the very latest. I am completely unimpressed just because somebody has a Galaxy 10 or iPhone 273+ (that won\'t work anyway because the battery is dead). Being an early adopter is ludicrous. Oh, and check out cricket. We have 4 lines, unlimited everything, for a hundred bucks a month! Excellent service coverage. Update: After 2 weeks - I REALLY love it! My old phone would die after 3 hours using Waze. On a recent trip, I used Waze for 11 hours, plus playing audios, plus keeping up with messaging and emails and still ended the day with about 50% battery! With light to moderate use, I\'ve gone 3 full days on a single charge. It\'s great not having to lug around an external battery or worry about having a charger. It also charges fully in 1-2 hours. 4 weeks now and still love it! Works perfectly. 10 mos now and this Moto G is still perfect!']"

Name: 7, dtype: object","[""I don't write many reviews, but since this phone is new to the US market, I thought I would throw my two cents in. I have only had two smartphones since 2016, yep I was a big hold out, and they were both cheap BLU phones, so I don't have much to compare this to. It's more phone than I need, and it's a great phone so far, except for one thing. It has no LED notification light. I didn't know this when I bought it, and I'm struggling. The reason I decided to replace my year and a half old phone is that the notification light constantly flashed for no known reason. I always have sound off, and I'm not always right near my phone, so it's annoying thinking I missed a call or text and checking my phone, I realize it's just a glitch. This phone doesn't tell me I missed a call or message unless I check it. I think that's better, but only slightly. Some people will not be bothered by this, but I only realized this after I bought it, even after reading many reviews. The fingerprint sensor is ok, fails sometimes, and I have no screen protector, but it might fail more often with one. You can use the PIN option as well. It takes pretty good pictures, but again, I can only compare with not so great phones. I thought I would be wowed by this phone after reading all the reviews and coming from a true budget phone, but I'm just on the fence. So essentially my two cents is do a lot of research and make sure this, or any phone, has the features you want, because while this phone is new to the US market and is getting rave reviews, there might be a better phone out there even cheaper.""]"

Amateur d’une autre marque chinoise, j’ai tout de même voulu donner sa chance à ce BlackView A80.\n\n📦 A la réception, le packaging est dans le standard de ce qui se fait de bien :\n- Le téléphone équipé d’un film de protection d’écran et d’une coque souple\n- le chargeur USB 2A\n- le cable d’alimentation USBC\n- le micro-casque avec prise jack\n- les documents\n- le petit accessoire pour accéder au tiroir de carte SIM\n- un film de protection d’écran supplémentaire (ce n’est pas du verre)\n\n📱 A l’allumage, la configuration se passe très bien. On se retrouve vite sur un Android qui ne semble pas avoir trop de surcouche ni applications installées en abondance. Je n’ai remarqué qu’une application « BV Family » qui permet de suivre les actualités de Blackview. C’est très agréable d’être dans cet environnement sobre. Je ne sais pas, par contre, si le suivi des versions Android sera régulier. A ce jour (fin mai 2020), il est en Android 9 avec une mise à jour de sécurité au 5 décembre 2019.\n\n👪 J’ai pu installer Google Family pour enfant et peut ainsi superviser le temps (et les horaires) d’utilisation ainsi que les applications. Mon ancien téléphone ne me permettait pas d’installer cette appli de contrôle parental. Le Blackview A80 remplit donc son rôle.\n\n🏁 J’ai pu lancer Antutu (pas dispo sur Play Store) pour savoir ce qu’il avait dans le ventre. Le résultat est proche de 100 000 (voir photo). C’est tout à fait correct dans un téléphone de cette gamme de prix. Et ce score se sent aussi au quotidien. Les applications en général sont fluides, il est très agréable à utiliser.\n\n📷 Côté photo, les multi objectifs semblent bien faire leur boulot. Je vous mets 2 exemples de photo prises avec une belle luminosité. Le résultat est excellent. Avec une plus faible luminosité, c’est un peu moins net (un peu de bruit), mais ça reste des photos sympas.\n\n🔑 Côté sécurité, ma fille utilise le capteur d’empreinte situé à l’arrière. Elle a eu quelques soucis de reconnaissance de son doigt, mais c’était la première fois qu’elle faisait ce genre de manipulation. Elle a enregistré à nouveau son doigt et tout est rentré dans l’ordre. Sinon, nous aurions sûrement pu faire comme sur mon précédent téléphone en enregistrant deux fois le même doigt.\n\n🔊 Le petit regret serait éventuellement sur la qualité du haut-parleur. Il n’est pas sensas. Une petite enceinte connectée Bluetooth permettra plus facilement de mettre un peu d’ambiance.\n\n🏁 Au final, le téléphone je trouve que le téléphone est super intéressant en terme de positionnement. L’écran, le processeur, l’appareil photo et le stockage sont au rendez-vous. Ma fille est ravie. Moi aussi.\n\nPS : J\'espère avoir pu vous éclairer avec mon retour d\'expérience. Si tel est le cas, n\'hésitez pas à cliquer sur ""Utile"", cela me fera très plaisir. Merci !']"

Name: 9, dtype: object","[""I am going to step you through each aspect of the phone and my thoughts so far.\n\nShort Version\n\nPro's\n- Price is seems very low for what you get.\n- Battery life is shockingly good. (ha)\n- Phone feels amazing in the hand, the one piece of aluminum shell can't be beat\n- Durability of this thing is on point, designed to last instead of break.\n- Speaker sounds great and achieves good volume.\n- Bare bones android, the dream.\n- Comprehensive antenna set for travel.\n\nCon's\n- No usb C connector, uses the more common micro usb.\n- Stock camera software is extremely basic, enough for most users but weak for those looking for those great shots.\n- Processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it's barely noticeable.\n- Phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection.\n- It doesn't make me breakfast.\n\nFeel and buttons: The phone feels extremely high quality, it's the only phone that I really hate having a case on because the aluminum feels so nice. The power and volume buttons are also aluminum and very solid, there have been complaints about them being hard to press, they aren't, they are just stiff enough that you won't easily accidentally press them like all other phones.\n\nTouch screen and fingerprint sensor: The screen felt a little off to me and it doesn't register touch perfectly but it's on par with other flag ship phones I've owned and I am still just getting use to it. The finger print sensor on this phone is amazing, it is covered with durable glass and reads finger prints very well. If you have issues with it re-enter your print, when I did it worked great.\n\nBattery: Holy crap, I've never, ever, had a phone that lasts like this one with the stock battery, my previous phone had an extended battery that more then doubled it's capacity and this phone doesn't drain much faster then it did. Charges reasonably quick and doesn't turn into a fire brick while charging and doing tasks.\n\nCamera: Ok, so my last phone had an amazing manual mode with full shudder speed controls and the works. This one comes with a stock android camera app that is pretty weak for features and merely ok at capturing good shots. Apps like open camera help resolve this but it's a little bit buggy on this phone, especially when trying to control shudder speed. I can't speak a lot to the selfie camera because I don't really use them.\n\nSpeaker: How does something this cheap have speakers this good? I don't have an answer, I'm just really happy it does. It's not super loud, it reaches about average volume, but does it with rich sound for a phone.\n\nSoftware: Stock android, no bloat other then the amazon apps but who isn't using prime? The ads are very easy to ignore and I'll gladly ignore an ad for 50 dollars, I honestly don't even notice them.\n\nAntenna's/Travel: One of the reasons I purchased this phone is because I am spending some time in Europe and it has, by far, the most comprehensive LTE antenna setup for the cost. I searched forever trying to find a phone with the 3,7,20 bands for Europe, I was struggling to find flag ship phones that had it and here it is on a entry level.\n\nDurability: The Youtuber JerryRigEverything said this may be his pick for most durable phone of 2017. I could have guessed that when it arrived. If you look closely at the phone you can see the spacer built between the screen and the outer edge of the phone, creating a bumper to help protect it. A thin rubber case is enough to make this phone very unlikely to be damaged. Even if you fall victim to the the very satisfying feel of this phone without a case you'd have to give it a pretty harsh drop to crack it.\n\nIf I think of anything else I'll edit the review later, if you have questions comment on this review and I'll try to address them. Finding the right phone to fit your situation can be tough but I believe this particular phone can fit nicely into most peoples situations.""]"

Name: 9, dtype: object","[""I have been watching this phone's development for awhile now, as I am a happy previous Nokia phone user. Every Nokia I've owned has taken my abuse and continued to work flawlessly. Obviously smartphones are different, but I had hoped that some of that resilience could rub off on Nokia's new foray into Android smartphones.\n\nThe build quality: This phone is machined and built to a much higher standard than any sub $400 phone on the market. It is solid, and feels great in hand, that is of course until I put a case on it. But its initial build quality does give me some confidence that it will handle day to day abuse without much issue.\n\nPerformance: I was a bit worried by the processor in this phone and had wished Nokia went with the Snapdragon 625 like their competitor, Motorola. Of course, the Moto 5g also didn't have 4GB of RAM, so it too was a tradeoff. So far though, after having installed my apps and put the phone under my own typical multitasking load, I am impressed by its overall responsiveness. It is not a speed demon by any means, but it doesn't hang or lag in any way that is frustrating. I can seamlessly go from streaming a podcast to surfing the web, watching netflix, mapmyrun, to using Google maps without a single hiccup. Fellow Android users, I'm sure you know when its time for you to reboot your phone because it starts to get laggy: I haven't had to reboot the phone since I got it. I'm not a super power user, but I do multitask on my phone, I just don't run power intensive games--would rather game on my PC or PS4. I think the fact that the phone runs stock Android also plays to the phones' relatively modest processor.\n\nBattery life seems to be very good on this phone. I can get 2 full days of usage if I'm a bit lean on using the screen. Can always get well over a full day with it even if my face is glued to it.\n\nCamera: Its fine for what it is. I use it mostly as a scanner for documents, or for random documentary shots. It is responsive and the image quality is OK. I personally don't really care, as I carry a dedicated camera with me that is significantly better than any smartphone could ever be.\n\nOverall, I think Nokia has a solid hit on their hands. The phone does everything I need it to do without frustrating me with heavy lag or glitches. And it does all this in an attractively designed body and a dirt cheap price tag.""]"

"Mobile    [Nokia 6 - 32 GB - Dual Sim Unlocked Smartphon...
Name: 9, dtype: object","['Disclaimer: I bought this phone after 5 years of using iPhones.\n\nThis Nokia is worthy of the brand name from a hardware perspective. It is very solid (has been dropped from pocket height too many times and is none the worse for wear), has great ""feel"" in the hand, and the screen seems much more scratch resistant than my previous iPhones - no micro-scratches at all after 4 months of use without a case and no screen protector (the phone only cost $300 - why waste money on a case). Most of all, I find it really great looking. Still after 4 months, when I look at it I think HMD Global did a great job of the design.\n\nThe software is almost pure Google Android, and is updated automatically to the latest. This is a good thing, compared to phones that come with poorly coded bloatware. The only Nokia software seems to be the Support app, which can be used to get live chat help from HMD Global. The phone is fast enough for normal daily use, though it does slow down after some time of not being rebooted, and so a restart once a week keeps it running fast as new, which is not great but is not a big deal either. Not sure if that is OS or phone firmware issues.\n\nFor me the negatives are the aspects Google brings to the table with the OS. To be clear, it is not ALL negative - the software is mostly fine. However, some very basics (in my mind) have been missed or poorly implemented by Google. For example, there is no separate control for notifications volume. It seems tied to the ring volume. For me phone ring (rare) and notification alerts sound (frequent) are not related at all. This means if you have dozens of apps, you get absurdly loud notification sounds if you have your ringer set to be loud enough to hear when the phone rings outdoors. The only answer is to go into each app one-by-one and turn off notifications, but that doesn\'t help for the core apps where I do want notifications - they are still too loud. Web forums are filled with such Android sound complaints, but no fix seems to be planned.\n\nAlso, things that should be simple are not well executed. Google\'s own apps such as Keep crash when switching between apps using the multi-task button. As well, the volume management in software is even more wonky, such as when I connect to a bluetooth speaker, the volume used for that device affects the overall volume of the phone even when not connected to the speaker any longer (speaker off) - example: after playing the speaker loudly, the minimum possible volume on the phone for music is very loud and has fewer ""steps"" between volume levels - i.e. the first ""step"" after zero (no volume) is already very loud.\n\nThere are several simple things in software that are surprisingly bad for an OS in version 8.1. The notifications volume control issue should\'ve been a version 1 or 2 feature.\n\nI would give the phone hardware a 5 star rating. The hardware quality for the price is really well done. The purchased device drops to 3 stars due to software issues that should\'ve been corrected years ago.\n\nApple is very smart not to license iOS. If iOS could run on this great $300 Nokia hardware, Apple\'s hardware division would be in trouble.']"

Name: 10, dtype: object","[""I bought this phone for my younger brother, who has been an Umidigi user for more than five years and was in the ned of a cheap, yet trustable device. This phone served this purpose and surprised us with an incredible camera set up.\n\nPros:\n\n- Price: In this market, getting a $169.99 phone + 2-day shipping (if you are a prime user) + Stock android + great set of cameras = Fantastic\n\n- Screen: Despite my dislike of the bottom chin, the screen quality it's great. Very bright, fluid, and QHD. Yes, you read it right, QHD. Tell me a phone at this price range with something that it is not Full HD? Exactly, just this one.\n\n- Battery life: Using youtube + phone calls + messaging + WiFi + Data = I got 32% at the end my day (around 10 PM). Like any other phone, you will charge it at the end of the day to have it ready.\n\n- Headphone jack: Look, I love my Bluetooth headset. But when it comes to audio quality, there's nothing better than to be 'old school' and plug your headphones. With this feature disappearing, having the option is great.\n\n- Expandable storage: Despite the 128GB internal memory setup, you can spend $20 to get 128 GB more through SD. Cheap, reliable, and easy fix.\n\n- 2 SIM cards: You can use up to two SIM cards on the same phone. I don't use this feature, but I know some of you may like it.\n\n- Unlocked + Global 4G VoLTE bands: In short, you can use this phone with any carrier that uses a SIM card in the world. Also, since T-mobile is now switching to phones that are 4G VoLTE capable only (sorry 3G phones), this phone will work.\n\n- Cons (only one):\n\n- RAM: Despite the ram is the second-to-last generation available in the market (top of the line phones are now using the LPPDRX5), it's fast and reliable. However, the only negative point to me is that it has only 4 GB of ram. My brother, who is coming from an Umidigi phone he bought 5 YEARS AGO, has 6 GB of ram. I think this is the only weak spot on this phone. However, if you don't have 20 apps running in the background, the new android manager (pre-installed in Android 10) will do magic with this ram amount, and you won't even feel a difference with phones that have 6 or 8 GB.\n\nSummary: A great mid-range phone, with great cameras, and unbeatable price.\n\n(If you made it to the end, thank you for time)""]"

Name: 10, dtype: object","[""Let's get the question on everybody's mind out of the way first: Will the UMIDIGI A7 Pro perform as well as a top-tier flagship smartphone from other OEM's - no. Will it perform well in your everyday tasks that most users need a smartphone for - absolutely!\nAfter using the phone for a few days I was pleasantly suprised by just how will it performed for all but the most processor intensive games.\nFirst impressions are extremely important and can make or break your opinion of a device which is why I wanted to include a couple of pictures that show just how much attention to detail and thoughtfullness was put into that all important first impression.\nFrom the little outer sleeve, to the thank you card, through the notes on the front and back screen protectors, and ending with the script on the sleeve containing the little quick start guide and sim extraction tool are all classy.\nNote that both a case and screen protector are pre-installed on the phone.\nOnce you remove the case you get a glimpse at the beautiful finish on the back of the phone, blue is the color I picked and boy does it ever shine and shimmer in the light. Really nice job. Also on the back is the four camera module housed in a rectangular bump. Again I'd like to point out the attention to detail here with the layout and something as seemingly simple as the font and color used for the text, and making the flash element look like a light strip.\nI'm 'color blind' so I can't comment on the color accuracy of the photos I've taken but they are, in my opinion, quite good as far as subject reproduction.\nThe addition of a macro and wide angle lenses make a difference and aid in getting just the right shot.\nThere were two OTA updates available from UMIDIGI which I installed - now, that may seem normal, but what wasn't was that there was a description of what bugs were addressed and features that would be added.\nAnother pleasant surprise was that there was no bloatware installed - only a subset of Google apps that most people would install anyway.\nUMIGIDI has gone very light with the skinning of Android which no doubt helps keep the performance of the device up, especially when combined with 4GB of RAM and 128G of storage space (which is expandable). Little helpful touches like having the choice to turn off alerts for turning off the screen or plugging in the charger are a welcome addition. The fingerprint reader on the back is as fast and accurate as ant other I've used. The screen is bright and easy to read.\nBattery life has been impressive, I got the phone Sunday afternoon and even after the rigours of setting up a new device, installing all of the software and updates, and getting everything configured the way you want it, I still had 20% remaining as I write this on Tuesday evening.\nAs stated in my description, this phone may be inexpensive, but the combination of build quality and feature set make it perform far above the price you've paid for it.\nYou will not be disappointed if you decide to purchase this device as long as you are not a hard core gamer.""]"

They've packed so much cool useful features on this budget phone when I first saw they had the new A7 Pro here on Amazon I went for it, glad I did!\n\nIt's good to look online and see the videos with information on this phone, the specs are everything I wanted, 128 memory with the option to add more if you wanted. Also able to have two sim cards on this phone I can see this being great for people who travel a lot.\n\nOnce I unpackaged it from the box in hand this isn't any light flimsy phone, it's a tad heavier than my S8. Personally, I like this as it doesn't feel cheap or easy to break during a fall.\n\nAnother thing I rarely see is the A7 Pro came with a beautiful case as well as a factory screen protector which is a huge difference as this is the first thing I do when I get a new phone is to protect it. They have packed so much into this phone for SUCH A LITTLE PRICE!\n\nType C charging it's the modern way to charge new devices its nice to see they went with type c charging. In the box, they have included both charging cable & charging block. With a BEAST of a battery 4150mAh goodbye to having to charge my phone every night as it stays charged for close to two days!\n\nTo me, this is a huge upgrade from my Galaxy S8 to this Umidigi A7 Pro so this must say something.\nEven with the Quad camera in the back will allow you to take some very cool snapshots & Videos.\nWith the front-facing 16MP resolution Selfie camera.\n\nI was super excited to get this it's now my daily phone, it's well worth the small price tag as you get some much with this phone. Hope this helps with your purchase.\n\n××EDIT××\nSuch a great phone buying another 64GB A7 Pro for my youngest daughter, the appearance of the phone, in general, is beautiful. For $199.99 it's a steal. Even has a biometrics finger printer scanner.\nRunning the current Android 10. It may be a tad slow as it has one of the older chips. It's nothing noticeable. They've packed so much into this budget device and I am a total fan. Just bought another one thank-you!""]"

I was looking at the UMIDIGI brands and researched them for a bit to find out that they are the new beginning of flagship killers. All the UMIDIGI phones are packed with good first or secondary choice hardware, and has capabilities of a top-notch flagship killer.\n\nThis phone was fast, aesthetic, good build, durable. Specific specs that I liked about this phone would be the dual SIM card slot (because not many phones have dual SIM\'s *cough* flagship), extra storage (comes with MicroSD card slot), the beautiful 6.3"" full HD screen, long battery life of 4150mAh, and not much or any bloatware (which means it doesn\'t come with many apps on first startup). It comes with a case which is great and lastly, it has ""decent"" speakers. I wouldn\'t say they\'re above average, but they do produce a great and loud sound. It lacks bass though.\n\nCons, for the price you\'re paying, you\'re expected to have some sacrifice like the camera. If you\'re a really keen and hard user for cameras, I do not suggest you buy this phone. It will take average pictures and the settings and aperture adjustments aren\'t very good. Otherwise, if you just wanna capture memories on an ""average"" camera, then yeah this phone would be good.\n\nOverall, for the price, you get what you paid for. That\'s my experience with it. I\'m happy I bought it for my friend and he loves it as well as me.']"

Name: 12, dtype: object","[""My company has had many employees lose phones due to water damage. We work along water ways, etc. So far the Blackview phone line up has solved that issue for us. These are water proof for over an hour, and at a depth of a couple meters. This phone is built around the premise that it can be around, dust, dirt, water, basically anything industrial and in the trades. It is IP68 waterproof standard compliant.\n\nThe screen is full HD and built over 6 inches in size. The touch screen quality is as good as my iPhone and the face ID and touch ID are as responsive. The operating system Android Pie 9 works well and is stable for us. We get no lag between photos, apps, etc. The P35 Helio CPU is fast, and the built in memory which comes with the phone is pretty small which isn't great but it's expandable to 128gig which is all I need. The expanded memory and using Amazon or Google pics to keep my photos and videos in the cloud results in lots of extra phone storage. The battery also stores a ton of juice. So much so that the phone can be used as an external battery charger for other devices.\n\nGPS, the compass, text to talk, talk and search all work very well. Being able to talk and take photos under water is pretty cool too. Also, the phone can be dropped and is rated for a 1.5 meter drop without additional protection. The metal bezel gives the phone lots of strength and can take any abuse I've thrown at it.\n\nThe one downside is the phone is semi thick, but the phone doesn't need a case.

I still have a dozen old computers dating back to the late '90s, all of them work. Today, seems we pay 3-5x the price for phones, and they make certain that they fail in less than two years. Or in this case, less than 6 mo. Get what you pay for I guess... think about it, $600-800 for a phone that lasts what 18-24 mo., and your paying about $33 per month for the hardware, the phone. Then, it dies, and you must get a new one.\n\nWith this phone, you pay $30, and it lasts 5 mo. that's $6 per month for hardware... So, in that regard... it's a great deal... THEY SAVED ME 80% over high priced garbage... like Apples, Oranges, Droids and the like.\n\nBut, I will have to think about spare phones in the closet, as I can't wait for replacements...\n\nOr, maybe, I can find a better deal..??\n\nThe kicker, in the 5 mo. of use, for both phones, we made perhaps 6-8hrs in calls. Less than 2hrs a mo. We use them mostly to do testing for apps and websites... Very light use, as we only have one app at a time, and then delete it, no extra apps, no test longer than 40 min. Did maybe 2-3 per week, so maybe 40-50 tests total or about 38hrs use for apps. We don't play games, but if you do, and play an hour a day... that would be like 150hrs use in 5 mo.\n\nSo, I can't recommend this phone for any ordinary person expecting to play some games and make 10 hrs a week of calls. Probably last like 96 days doing that.\n\nAnyway, be careful, run your numbers... if my first one lasts another couple months, the math may be favorable enough to keep buying as throwaways...\n\nOoh this one, the screen went black can't reset, just get to make funny noises... not very entertaining""]"

It is FAST, reliable, and a steal for $300. The front camara takes good pictures as well as decent pictures with the back camara. When using the phone to make calls you'll find that the calls have a great quality.\n\nThe problem is that when I called my girlfriend on Facebook and put her on speaker she could hear herself talking and a lot of echo. I did connect my Bluetooth headphones to the phone and she still heard echo and a repetition of what she was saying. I thought this might have been a Facebook issue so we tried other apps (WhatsApp and Discord) and the same thing continued. I restarted the phone and erased the apps and nothing changed.

I\'m somewhat of a tech nerd and I\'ve used a ton of different phones over the years. The S5 pro is simply my favorite phone that I also think is very underappreciated.\n\nTo clarify, I have never owned a ""flagship"" phone, but most of my friends have $1000 phones and I have used them/seen them use them very often. For the average consumer, this phone isn\'t just a good competitor: it\'s on the same level as phones that cost a minimum of $600.\n\nLet\'s look at some of the advertised features:\n1) amoled screen: really does look phenomenal\n2) in display fingerprint scanner: very accurate with a cool animation and haptic feedback. It certainly isn\'t the fastest but it\'s still relatively new technology that\'s typically on much pricier phones\n3) Helio G90T ""Gaming Processor"": it really is a powerful processor. This phone is actually fortnite compatible, unlike most Mediatek devices. I have played fortnite, Sky: Children of Light, and dead cells and they all look and run excellent.\n4) liquid cooling system: I have no way of verifying it\'s effectiveness but the phone does stay relatively cool\n5) 256 gigs of storage is absurd value for the price\n6) ""48 megapixel AI Quad Camera"": one area where this phone can\'t quite match the $1000 options. However, the pictures still look great and there are some really neat options and settings included.\n7) motorized pop-up camera: works perfectly, it\'s ultimately preference. I do see why some people would prefer a normal camera notch but this is an extremely interesting and premium feature. It is ""slow"" compared to some, but in all actuality it doesn\'t take long at all.\n\nThe battery is great, and the loudspeaker actually sounds pretty good as well. The entire build quality is as good as any devivice out there. It also looks stunning.\n\nFinally, let\'s talk about some cons:\n1) most likely will not receive any Android system updates\n2)case options are really limited, but it is nice that a basic one comes with it.\n3) no headphone jack (it does include an adapter though)\n\nThe biggest pro of all is the fact that is has support for nearly all the US lte bands. Unlike some other big-name manufacturers (you know who I\'m talking about) who also produce good value phones. This really separates Umidigi phones from the competition and it\'s why I love them.']"

Granted, there are better phones out there, but they will cost you far more.\n\nAnyways, just some pros to note for me - 1) 256GB of expandable storage is CRAZY for $300 2) AMOLED display is excellent with wonderful color replication and accuracy 3) Camera quality is superb 4) Helio G90T packs a serious punch 5) Build quality is exceptional 6) STOCK ANDROID! 7) They include a USB C to 3.5mm jack cable which is very much so appreciated!\n\nI really don't have anything bad to say either.

The night shots are good too but not as good as an iPhone. Front facing camera pops up every time you need it for use, it works fast in any social media that requires access to the camera, and surprisingly it felt to me that it was better than the rear cameras.\n\nThe battery life of the phone is great, for normal use it lasts a day without any worry. If you plan to do gaming for hours it might need an extra recharge during the day, my point is that if this phone is for a kid they will need to charge in the middle of the day if they keep playing non stop.\n\nThe processor is great for gaming, you can play games without any lag and jitter, which also reminds me to mention the wifi speed for downloads, it is blazing fast. I did try to install another launcher and it really struggled and gave some bugs to the phone, so I suggest you to avoid any 3rd party launchers to avoid any issues with the phone.\n\nThe phone has dual sim capability which works as expected, it does have microSD card input but I don't find it necessary knowing that the phone comes with 256GB internal.\n\nOverall, it is not the fastest phone or the perfect camera, but it does give you the perfect display and battery life and the power to do gaming, which is what the phone is intended to do so, I would like to have less cameras with better qualities, but that is just me who is a professional photographer. I would recommend this phone for kids who want power for gaming and a good display to watch videos and streams for gaming, which also reminds me the speaker of this phone is loud and enjoyable.""]"

My old S8 they've stopped updates. It's best to be with the latest version for security reasons. In my opinion.\n\nThe phone came unlocked to any phone carrier, I am currently with Kodo Mobile had no problems with making calls or using the internet. The phone is able to add more memory by SD card. This phone is mint condition and I love it.\n\n×Edit×\nIf you enjoying playing games on your phone like CODM or Fort, this phone plays flawlessly without any problems whatsoever. This helps to have 6GB of RAM it's plenty enough RAM for a phone. Also works great as a business phone as you can multi-task without problem or zero lag.

The camera mode even has an option the show you what it would look like if you recorded the video if you took a low-light video or if you took a standard picture it shows each of those on the screen at the same time so you can see what would be the best choice.\nThe smart key that you can program to do three different things is really great. I have a long press to put the phone on silent, I have a quick press to pull up Google Assistant, and I have a 3 press to pull up search which works for both searching on the phone or on the Internet simultaneously.

I also like the edge trigger on the screen you can program it open up 12 different apps that you might use frequently. And you can use it to access contacts that you frequently use and you can customize both of those to your liking. And the edge trigger actually works very well unlike the Moto Edge and third-party apps with the OnePlus 8.

"Mobile    [Google Pixel 4a - New Unlocked Android Smartp...
Name: 18, dtype: object","[""If you want to buy an US Android smartphone that has minimal out-of-the-box bloatware, a headphone jack, fingerprint sensor, great camera, and an unlockable bootloader, there is only one phone on the market that meets that criteria, the Pixel 4a. I personally desire these features on my smartphone, but manufacturers have been removing them from their flagship smartphones from sometime. I used to only buy smartphone flagships and was always excited to upgrade. I purchased the first Google Pixel XL on launch day back in 2016 and it has been the best phone I’ve ever used. I loved my Pixel XL so much I have tried to replace it twice but ended up selling the newer phones as I considered them to be inferior. My Pixel XL stopped receiving software updates from Google a while back, but I’ve been able to extend its lifespan by loading LineageOS on it.\n\nSubsequent Pixel flagships have removed several features I want on my phone or added features I did not want. The Pixel 2 series removed the headphone jack, the Pixel 3XL had an ugly notch mimicking the iPhone X, and the Pixel 4 (non-A) series does not have fingerprint sensors.\n\nIt really does not make sense that the Pixel 4a, a budget offering, has more features than the Pixel 4, but this is the reality we live in. I’d like to quickly run over the things I love about this device before I start tearing into with criticism. I love that it has a headphone jack. I have no problem with wireless technology, but Bluetooth in 2020 still provides inferior sound quality when compared to a wired connection. When I’m in my car or listening to headphones, I want a wired connection for the best quality possible. Wired headphones also don’t require batteries meaning they are much more environmentally friendly and never require battery replacement.\n\nI also love that this phone has an unlockable bootloader. If you want to keep this phone past the 3 year window of software support Google offers, you can load an aftermarket ROM on your device like LineageOS. It’s also a plus if you want to root your device. Many smartphone manufacturers (Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, Motorola, to name a few) either don’t allow this or limit the functionality to certain models which I consider unacceptable. Can you imagine if you bought a computer with Windows 7 but were forbidden from loading Windows 8 or Ubuntu on it? You don’t have to imagine, that’s essentially what most smartphone manufacturers do. Google doesn’t and I appreciate that.\n\nWhile an unlockable bootloader is nice, I would say that most people would like to use their new phones with out-of-box software as long as possible. Google’s version of Android is the closest thing to pure/bloatware-free that you can get. There are no duplicate apps (except YouTube/YouTube Music), and almost everything can be uninstalled or disabled out of the box. Mine did come with a T-Mobile app which I saw as strange since it’s an unlocked phone, but I was able to uninstall it. This is what I like to see. Other brands such as Samsung have gone as far as to create entire duplicate app stores, calendars, mail apps, assistants, and internet browsers that are not removable from their phones. Others, like OnePlus, now put Facebook services on phones out of the box. I am glad that Google has not embraced these practices and still leaves app choice up to the owner of the phone.\n\nThe camera, like on all Pixel phones, is fantastic. Great low-light performance and amazing detail, contrast, and color. No other smartphone on the market can compare with the Pixel series of phones when it comes to cameras. Both the front and rear shooters take great shots, but for reasons I’ll get to later, I hate the front camera.\n\nSo what are the compromises? This thing is cheap, gross, fingerprint-attractive plastic. In all honesty, I hate all plastic. Plastic is what disposable products are made from. I don’t want a plastic phone. Make it out of aluminum, steel, glass, whatever. But plastic is not acceptable on any smartphone in 2020, even a budget one. Immediately when I took this phone out of the box I hated how it felt in my hand. It feels like a kid’s tox, reminiscent of the iPhone 5c. You may think this is being harsh on a $350 phone but the iPhone SE 2 is made from aluminum and is the same price. The aesthetic design of the phone isn't too bad, if it were made of aluminum it would be a nice looking phone, that is, if it weren't for what I'll get into next.\n\nThe screen is horrible. It’s only 1080p-equivalent (my Pixel XL from 2016 is 1440p, it’s not wide enough for my taste, and rather than have a bezel on the top of the phone like on the Pixel 4, Google instead decided to embrace the hole punch-style front camera design popularized by Samsung. Whenever you look at this phone, you are going to see this camera. It sticks out like a sore thumb, a giant black mark on the screen. It’s even worse when you’re watching videos in portrait mode, as the top of the display darkens to simulate an artificial bezel. If the video you’re watching is dark then rather than seeing the beautiful perfect black scenes you can achieve with an OLED screen, you see the camera. It’s also a distraction when you’re viewing a wide photo or video in landscape mode, it’s a giant black dot on the side like a fly landed on the screen. I spend a lot of time watching videos on my phone and this is not acceptable. When in dim rooms the camera hole is also very reflective and will shine light right into your eyes, adding further distraction. The only thing I can compliment is that at least the hole is off to the side and not in the center. It’s still terrible.\n\nI’m not happy with the fingerprint sensor. It’s plastic so it feels terrible, but it also doesn’t seem to read fingerprints well. To its credit it does read quickly, much more quickly than my Pixel XL, but I find myself having to read my print three or four times just to get it to unlock. I prefer optical under-screen fingerprint sensors such as those found on the OnePlus series of phones but can accept a rear fingerprint sensor if it’s accurate and quick. The sensor on the 4a does not seem to be accurate.\n\nThe battery is too small at 3140mah. There are budget Indian and Chinese phones that are packing 4000mah+ batteries into smartphones of similar size, Google is lagging behind the competition. They’ve advertised this as having “adaptive” battery optimization and while it seems to perform fairly well out of the box, how well will it perform after several major updates and a few hundred charge cycles? One of my last jobs was spent working with batteries and one of the things I learned is that when it comes to lithium-ion cells, higher capacity + lower discharge depth = longer lifespan. Even if this phone can get you through morning to night with 10-15% capacity left of a 3,140mah battery, you’ll be left with a battery lasts less long than if you had a 4000mah battery ending the day at 30% before going back on the charger. Lithium-ion cells also degrade as they’re cycled. After 100 cycles a Lithium battery can lose as much as 5%-10% of its capacity. If you start with a larger cell then that degradation will be less of an issue as age sets in. Needless to say, Google fumbled on battery size.\n\nI think this is the best new Android phone on the market, but in the same breath, I think that reflects poorly on the Android smartphone market. You might think my criticisms are harsh considering the low price of the phone, but I did not buy this phone because it was cheap. I bought it because it has the features I want. If I had the option of buying a flagship smartphone with a headphone jack, fingerprint sensor, metal/glass body, excellent camera, large battery, no hole punch, and no bloatware, I would buy that. I can’t buy a new flagship smartphone like that so this is the next closest thing. I’m not even asking for luxury features like wireless charging. Basically, I feel no guilt in being critical towards the device’s flaws because my desires as a consumer are not being met by the companies I’m purchasing from. I would recommend this device if you need the features it has.""]"

You haven't been scammed if you don't find the wired headphones in the box!\nOriginal review: I say it's the best, with a grain of salt, read the cons to know why!\nTo start off, Samsung did an amazing job with this phone, so much that they rendered the fairly new, still very expensive, S20 Ultra, almost obsolete!\nBut I'm not gonna review both units here, so for those of you looking for quick pros & cons, here you go.\nPros:\n- AMAZING display, I had so many high end phones, including the IPhone 11 pro max and Google Pixel 4XL & even the note 10, but this screen here bests all of them. The high refresh rate, the beautiful colors, and the better ratio (it's a little wider than the S20 ultra for example), all this makes for an outstanding screen.\n- Great main camera. The pictures are just perfect in almost all light conditions. I dunno how much better is the 108 MP mode, it bothered me a little that cropping a 108 MP picture didn't yield the perfect result, but all in all, the camera is top notch, in all its modes. The videos are even better. You won't find a phone with a better main camera on the market.\n- The S pen is pretty useful for taking notes! I didn't feel like I needed it for anything else except, may be, for a selfie, so eventhough it isn't the biggest selling point, it's worth mentioning.\n- It looks great! Yup, design wise, that phone looks really good, that it feels bad putting any covers on it. I personally just ordered a very slim, transparent case & I wouldn't recommend anything else.\nThere are some added gimmicky features that you can find almost everywhere online, but I personally loved the direct share, where I can show anything I want from my phone and cast it to a smart TV or one with a Google chrome cast attached to it, it happened a lot before that I needed to show many people at the same time, whatever it is that was on my phone, photos or a certain app, and that feature here makes it so easy.\nCons:\n- I dunno how this isn't mentioned anywhere, but the selfie camera isn't great at all in low light conditions. Yes in the morning, outdoor, it is very good, but other than that it's just not great! I could see myself buying the next Google Pixel instead, just for this.\n- Battery life isn't good enough either. It's worse than my S20 Ultra, and it was no surprise, since Samsung decided to give this phone a smaller battery 🙄\nI find myself charging it twice a day, which really isn't practical.\nJust for those 2 points, added to the fact that it's a super expensive phone, I had to give it 4 stars.\nNow if it gets the Google Pixel software for the selfie camera, and a full day of battery life that would have been the best phone ever made! But I guess we'll have to wait for next year for that!""]"

Name: 19, dtype: object","[""To preface this, I am being forced to purchase a new device as all US networks are apparently no longer supporting Huawei devices in the very near future. I decided to give the Note a try as it seemed that it would keep up with my daily usage for work and I've always desired having the S pen.\n\nI've been using this phone for a few days now and it is soooooo slow. Apps and Google searches take way too long to load. Hotspot is just downright awful. Battery life is sub par. Fast charging is much slower than what I had. Camera doesn't quite compare to my old phone's Leica camera, which I figured it wouldn't. Not sure what kind of scam this is but I'm definitely returning it. Also didn't come with earbuds or the phone clone connector. Don't get me wrong, the phone looks great. The S pen was everything I was hoping for. The screen is spectacular and super bright. The 120hz refresh rate was cool for maybe the first 10 sec, then I realized it was a pretty worthless feature. Scrolling to the end of long page in a few seconds does me no good when I'm trying to read posts or search for information on that page.\n\nI went to AT&T to get my phone diagnosed. He tested it against his Note 20 Ultra and his phone ended up being twice as fast as mine running the same speed test, on the same network, on the same unlimited plan... all after my device took an additional 10-15 sec to connect before even starting the test.\n\nMy advice, don't waste your money. Just because Samsung markets like crazy doesn't mean their phones are any good. For a flagship device and the price point, this phone falls well short of being worth it. I came from a two year old Huawei Mate 20 Pro and it's sad that Samsung can't make a phone that is able to compete with it. Not what I expected for my first Note phone. I've never been a Samsung hater by any means, but this experience just solidifies my previous viewpoint to never buy a Samsung device. Won't make that mistake again.\n\nUpdate:\nI made that mistake again... In my defense, I was hoping this was an isolated incident or just a simple case of a bad device. I ordered another unlocked Note 20 Ultra from Best Busy to compare. Unfortunately for me, it was not. That device had all the same issues. Slow network speeds with AT&T (I live in a major city so this shouldn't happen, period). This phone also didn't come with earbuds so it seems like Samsung is just getting cheap on consumers.\n\nI tried swapping the SIM card with my girlfriend's S20 and it still didn't work. All calls were sent directly to voicemail and text messages were very hit or miss. AT&T had no idea, but I'm sure it was out of the hourly employees realm to troubleshoot. I had to switch back to my Huawei Mate 20 Pro. After 10 min or so I got a couple delayed text messages that were sent days ago in response to a text I originally sent from the Note 20 Ultra. SMH...\n\nI'm just downright confused at this point. Not sure whether it's an issue with the device or with the 5G network, or both. You also can't change which network bands you want to use, ie. turn 5G off. You can only toggle 2G on and off. My buddy has full control with his Note 10+ which is really mind boggling. Either way, both phones have been returned.\n\nI'm self-employed and my phone is my lifeline. I don't have time to play these games or wait for Samsung to release an update. Such a shame because I really wanted to like this phone and I loved the S pen so far. Samsung just has a history of not being able to meet my expectations. The even bigger shame is that I can't upgrade to better Huawei device...""]"

The billing that the average person will be able to make long flights right out of the box brings it down half a star. You\'ll realize why so much of their video instruction is based on making a paper airplane that flies well (without the PowerUp). It\'s all about the airplane. This just straps on it\'s back.\n\nDo not think of this as a radio controlled airplane or something that flies out of the box. This is a small Bluetooth controlled motor and rudder that you can attach to your paper airplanes. If you can\'t build a good paper airplane this will not fly for you. If you like to tinker and experiment I think you will love the PowerUp 3.0 regardless of your age or experience. I also think this would be a wonderful teaching and learning tool. It\'s inexpensive, easy to use, incredibly durable and provides instant feedback to aerodynamic experiments.\n\nI got it, charged it and folded the trainer airplane. It worked, only liked turns to the left, and is under powered but I had an airplane flying within minutes. It wasn\'t a great flyer so instantly I\'m thinking ""what if I do this..."" I can\'t tell you how fun I find making subtle changes and tweaks and seeing how they perform. Fold a new airplane and see how it does.\n\nI\'m a pilot and have built a full size airplane from scratch and have a good grasp of aerodynamics, center of gravity bla... bla... bla and at almost 50 I find this little thing a lot of fun. If you just want to buy something that will fly you might be disappointed but I absolutely love tinkering and experimenting with different airplane configurations and seeing how they turn out. All it takes is a minute to fold a new airplane and give it a try. I\'m already thinking of how to shed weight and make it perform even better.\n\nDurability... Well, so far I have not broken it. I\'ve crashed it onto a concrete driveway several times and once at full throttle into a brick wall and it just bounces off and is ready to go for the next flight. Everything is small. Small propeller, tiny rudder... so I don\'t think it would be appropriate for small children but it\'s durable enough for any detail oriented or careful handed youngster or old guy.']"

Name: 21, dtype: object","['This great gadget will take some effort to learn, and a VERY VERY calm wind day. But when you find yourself in a large, open, grassy (or beach sand) area it is a complete BLAST to fly! For once, I was happy to purchase a product that worked exactly as advertised.\n\nNote added later: I have had direct interaction with Power Up Toys since my initial review, and have found them to be quickly responsive and generally awesome to deal with. Wish I could tack on another star for great customer service.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Fold a good airplane, with elevator and rudder surfaces cut, that flies well and straight on its own. The ""Phantom"" model worked best for me as a starter. It was stable but very responsive in turning. Make sure your plane has plenty of dihedral angle, (check the manual), then, when you go to fly it with the module on, notice if the motor makes it turn one way or the other. I had to adjust for the motor on nearly every plane, I think it was right rudder that I added to bring it to straight flight, but observe for yourself, and adjust.\n\n2. Wait for a very VERY calm day. I initially couldn\'t wait, and tried on a marginal day. I paid for that decision with despair and irritation. Give yourself a break, wait for the calm. You will be rewarded for it.\n\n3. Turn off the ""Sleep"" mode on your phone, as well as the ability to receive calls or texts, like they recommend in the manual. On my first long flight, I looked down to change the throttle, and found the phone blank. Logging back in to the phone while flying was irritating, difficult, and unnecessary. Make sure the phone stays awake.\n\n4. At first, hold the phone vertically, (up and down), instead of flat when flying. Of course, you will be tipping it all over the place, but do it with the phone perpendicular to the ground, rather than parallel with it. Also, cut the enthusiasm. (Yes, initially I was a maniac. Dancing around, leaning out in both directions etc, while grinning ear to ear.) Smaller, gentler movements will reward you with a smoother, more controlled flight. Later you can engage ""movement"" based throttle, after getting the hang of flying.\n\n5. Understand that the throttle level will mainly affect two things: first, how much ""loft"" (the amount of nose-up climb), and second, the altitude at which the plane will fly. Adjustments to the elevator tabs at the back of the wing, in conjunction with the throttle will allow you to find the level flight ""sweet spot"", but it will usually take a few launches to get it right. Starting with the throttle in the seventies is a great piece of instruction from the manufacturer. Follow it. I found that initially adjustments to the throttle required that I look down at the phone and away from the plane I was trying to fly, so I had to keep them to a minimum.\n\n6. Test max distance a little at a time. I had to keep the plane to within 100 feet or so. They are rated for 200 feet, but I found that the bluetooth connection is twitchy past that point in my area, and every time I pushed the distance envelope, I lost control of the plane. Many onlookers were greatly entertained, watching me sprinting toward that spiraling plane, trying to re-establish contact. It was good cardio, but I would have been better advised to keep the plane closer. And remember, altitude is part of that distance. If the plane is ninety feet off the ground, (yes, it can happen), you need to be within ten feet of straight below it, (again, in my area).\n\n7. Understand that control is an illusion. We do not have true control over these paper planes, or else we wouldn\'t need so much open space to fly them around in. Our recommendations to turn this way and that are just that; recommendations. These things can and will go anywhere. The slightest stray breath of wind can blow them far off our intended course. Have fun with the idea of making what feels like thousands of steering recommendations a second just to try to keep the ship in the air, and understand that in the end, that is where the fun lies.\n\n8. Last but definitely not least, try the waterproof paper. Regular bond paper reacts so quickly with the ambient moisture in the air, that on a moist day, the plane can and will distort in mid flight, crashing for no apparent reason. If you\'re flying in a desert, maybe this is less of an issue.\n\nMany thanks to Power Up Toys for so much fun!']"

The phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865; the phone feels very smooth. The 120hz refresh rate also adds to the smoothness of the experience. 6gb of ram is sufficient for the vast majority of users. My s10+ plus had 8gb and I felt like I could have an endless amount of apps open. The same could be said with this phone. The cameras are quite good but I'd recommend testing out the phone in person.

Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.\n\nThe only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not.

Clean looking OS out of the box, very little bloatware installed from vendors and certainly won’t miss all the game apps\n–Big consideration for me was this model supports a broad range of GSM 4G LTE bandwidths, including 66 and 71. Wanted to feel comfortable it would be fully compatible with Cricket Wireless and MetroPCS. Dual band 802.11ac wifi support is a bonus, many competitors only support single band b/g/n\n–Smoothly transferred existing nano SIM card from Nokia 3.1C activated on Cricket wireless, but did have to manually use blue tooth connection between phones to transfer the contact list, only one phone is NFC compatible. Now receiving constant 5 full signal bars inside my house where I never had more than 3 with the Nokia without walking outside. MicroSDXC card, SanDisk Extreme, 64GB, rated read 160/write 60, U3, V30, A2, formatted FAT32\n–The benefits of the AMOLED display will help offset Umidigi’s low 720x1548 pixel resolution, mine has vibrant colors, true blacks and good contrast. Much better display colors by adjusting: Settings/Accessibility/Color Correction. Turn it On.\n–Decided this purchase would be an unlocked phone because Android and carriers manipulate how we install and configure apps and add home screen widgets\n–4GB of RAM is sufficient for most users, this model with 128GB ROM is good for users who store many files (pics, videos, TMs) on their phones. Read professional reviews, 4GB is good, 6GB would be nice and is preferred by gamers, but draws down the battery charge sooner\n–Three rear cameras will offer more creativity with still pics but users are advised to experiment with the features before relying on the cameras for serious pictures\n–Professional reviews state this model is supposed to receive the Android 10 update, we’ll have to follow Umidigi to be certain they deliver on the marketing hype\n–This model supports wifi calling, NFC and fast cable but not wireless charging\n–Umidigi has released at least two software updates, in Oct and Nov, addressing expressed consumer complaints pertaining to fingerprint sensor issues. Still leery about fingerprint and facial recognition security, so will continue using lock screen patterns/codes\n--As of 02/29/2020 and six months of ownership, no serious issues or hiccups mentioned by others except keyboard touch sensitivity resulting in repeated characters\n\nCons:\n–Biggest annoyance so far is highly sensitive touch screen, difficult swiping with finger or stylus without accidentally highlighting areas you didn’t intend and numerous repeated letters when texting. Have not found internet solution to adjust keyboard sensitivity. After six months of use, have decided to remove another star due to the keystroke repeat and delay in release of Android 10 update.\n–Included user manual is very basic, Umidigi has not posted anything more substantial if there is one as of\n06/17/2020 Not documented anywhere but think I found solution to overly sensitive keyboard repeating keystrokes: Tinker with a few of these settings and you\'ll get the screen touch right for you: Tap App Info, back arrow left, scroll to bottom System, Language & Input, Gboard, Preferences. I turned OFF ""Haptic feedback on keypress"" and ""Popup on Keypress""; turned ON ""Long Press for Symbols"" and changed ""Key Long Press Delay"" to 110ms. These adjustments seem to be working for me and I might fine tune it more over time. Added a Star to review\n02/29/2020\n–Umidigi X is relatively new, few third party protective covers are available, that should improve. Always prefer and highly recommend using wallet folio cases for best protection against damage. Found one, seller shipped from China on same day as ordered, arrived in 10 days, perfect fit and reduces likelihood of activating side volume/power controls.\n05/13/2020\n--Grateful Umidigi just released a May 9, 2020 security and camera HDR enhancement update, arrived on my phone May 13. Still no sign of the Android X upgrade and we\'re getting closer to the Android 11 release this Fall.\n\nOther thoughts:\n–This model includes bluetooth v4.2, surprised so many phones in this price range still offer bluetooth v4.1, a real deal breaker. My Nokia has the latest v5.0\n--Would like to purchase the S3 Pro but hesitant due to what I\'m experiencing with model X. The newer S5 Pro is overly priced and the A7 Pro is puny with the P23 CPU.']"

Name: 2, dtype: object","[""I absolutely love it! The design of the Umidigi X phone is gorgeous and provides many features compared to other higher-end cell phones that cost five or six times more.\n\nFingerprint Scanner: I was skeptical about the on-screen fingerprint sensor as I assumed it wouldn't be able to provide a proper functioning on-screen fingerprint sensor at the phone's price point, but I sure was wrong. The on-screen fingerprint sensor works like a charm, and it functions as fast as higher-end smartphones. The Umidigi X does have face recognition/unlock, but I personally like the fingerprint scanner.\n\nCamera: The Umidigi X phone's 48-megapixel three-camera setup and the 16-megapixel selfie camera is incredible. In my photos, I show how the camera on the Umidigi X can easily compete against other top smartphones.\n\nSpeed: The phone has stock Andriod 9 with no extra bloatware. It is fast and multi-tasks flawlessly. Opening and switching apps happen smoothly without lag. I don't game on any of my phones, but if you want to game on this phone, I am sure it will be able to handle basic and low graphic games.\n\nBattery: I have been using the Umidigi X phone for 48hrs now, and I can say, with its 4150mAh battery can easily last me all day, and yes, it outlasted my other phone.\n\n128GB Storage: Whenever I buy a new phone, 64GB is never enough, and 256GB is way too much storage for me, so I appreciate Umidigi defaults this phone to 128GB as I feel it is the perfect amount of room for most people. If 128GB is not enough for you, the phone has a MicroSD slot to expand storage.\n\nDesign: What can I say, the phone is beautiful! The flame design on the black glass and metal body looks fantastic. The only thing I wish Umidigi provided was a clear phone case instead of the included black case, so I can show off how amazing the phone looks. BTW, Yes, this phone has a 3.5 headphone jack and USB type-c fast charging.\n\nWould I recommend this phone?\nOf course, the Umidigi X is not going to be for everyone, especially for those who are already invested in another mobile ecosystem, but I say, Yes! I do recommend this phone. If you don't care about your texts appearing in blue bubbles, then I say save yourself seven hundred to one thousand dollars and get the Umidigi X.""]"

Because this A51 model works great in the US on Data LTE, MMS, and more (see below why).\nBecause this is Latin America model, it arrived in the Spanish language, however, the languages and countries are listed A to Z so I easily found ENGLISH, UNITED STATES. Very easy and LTE and Data works 100 percent with my AT&T service!\n\nI am a techy person that uses AT&T LTE on this phone, so I wrote this review so that you can decide if this might be the best phone for you or not...\n\nPRO FEATURES:\n\n1) All the necessary LTE BANDS for AT&T, TMobile and other GSM...I have AT&T LTE DATA. The description was accurate about all of the LTE Bands. It has enough LTE Bands to work great with AT&T.\n\nI travel, so at different locations, AT&T Cell Towers have different bands, at home, I receive Band 2 (LTE/4G+). Around town I am on, bands 2,4,5 and sometimes Band 17 depending on the tower location. Even on the road, my Data works great!\n\nI reseached several Websites who confirmed the above bands on this model before I purchased and they were correct.\nNote that the F model, this one is for NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. It works wonderfully on the United States.\n\n2) WIFI...This is a super strong WIFI. I get 5 bars all over my home and outside in back yard, 4 bars. The WiFi is super fast and stays connected!\n\n3) Storage Space and Battery Life...After the OS, Factory apps and after installing MANY LARGE APPS, I still have 110 GB left out of the 128GB, so I am very happy!\nBattery Info...First, the phone battery and CPU stay very cool between 71 and 85 degrees. On a battery charge with heavy app use, I still have 40 percent or more left at 11pm.\n\n4) Screen Clarity Ratio...This Screen is super sharp, bright and clear. It has approximately 415 nits of brightness (which is excellent), so at 100 percent brightness, viewing the display in sunlight is Ok.\nVideos are sharp, eBooks sharp etc.\nLike many tall, yet slim new phones these days, they are going to the ratio at 19:5 or higher. Some high end phones are going to 20, 21, so many older format 420p videos or lower don\'t 100 percent fill the screen because they were made for older devices with 16 or 18.\nI think that the newer videos will eventually catch up and fill the screen.\n\n5) Speed...I found this phone to be very responsive.\n\n6) It has a 3.5mm port for wired headsets. Both wired headsets and Bluetooth headphones sound great because this phone has Dolby Atmos Sound.\n\n6) Price, Form Factor, Near infinity screen...The price is reasonable and I love the 6.5"" screen. The form factor on this I is appreciate because this phone is so trim and slim and lightweight. It has very thin bezels so the screen truly fills up the phone.\n****The slimness of the phone is one of the main reasons I purchased this phone. The 6.5"" size is just right for me.\n\nCons:\nThis phone has 4GB of memory. It is fast enough but I\'d prefer 6GB or 8GB of memory. The phone doesn\'t lag or freeze so 4GB is adequate.\n\nWell, I hope that my detailed review has been helpful for you.\nI highly recommend this phone because it works wonderfully!']"

It seriously does. I've blown people's minds when they check out my phone compared to the $700-1000 phones they have. And I bought mine cash outright for a quarter what they paid. While they constantly search for power outlets, I use mine for 2-3, maybe 4 days without a charge. I don't use the fingerprint scanner, so I can't comment on it. For being someone my age (mid 20's), I prefer simplicity over newest tech. Something I love specifically however about this phone is the Moto gestures. Chop the phone twice, flashlight comes on. Shake the phone sideways twice, camera comes on. For the amount I work on cars and take visual notes or just need a quick light with gloves on, these are godsends and a genius idea. I feel the build quality of this phone seriously beats out Apple's laughing matters now, and quite a bit of the competition in the price range. This should be a $500 phone, easy. Pick this thing up, and enjoy a solid mid-level phone that mocks the flagships for a quarter of the price.""]"

Name: 5, dtype: object","[""Very nice phone. Screen is huge, battery can last me three days if I want it to, and the phone feels like a well made product. It has a look similar to many of the higher end phones without the huge price tag. The G7 Power is really fast, and allows me to do all my tasks for work quickly and efficiently. The Moto Actions are really handy, and the fingerprint swipe on the back unlocks the phone instantly. I'm also a huge fan of the USB Type-C.\n\nCall sound and microphone works great for me. I have also found it to be very nice that the cell phone speaker and call speaker are integrated together.\n\nAs far as cons, I would say the screen quality, while very good in my opinion, is not the same as higher end phones as you can see pixels when you really look at it. It is only really noticeable when you are really looking at it though.\nAdditionally, the camera is not the greatest. It gets especially grainy when you zoom in, but it does initialize fast and will be more than acceptable for most users.\nLastly, on Verizon, if I lose service (say, in a large building for example), and it later reconnects, it switches from LTE to 4G+. In 4G+, I notice it will not send or receive MMS messages. Not really sure what this is (Internet tells me that 4G+ is essentially a fast 3G connection) but it only goes back to LTE after I restart my phone. I am sure a software update will fix this.\n\nIf you are looking for a really decent phone at a great value, I would say do not hesitate to give the G7 Power a go. I very much enjoy it, and intend to keep it for a long time. Motorola/Lenovo has come a long way!""]"

Name: 6, dtype: object","[""This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price.\n\nPros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack.\nCons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included.\n\nI was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it).\n\nHowever, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices.\n\nI could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer.\n\nI do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful!\n\nConsidering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!)\n\nNew to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together.\n\nLastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal.""]"

You should know one thing going into buying the Pixel 3a: it comes with Google's Pixel launcher, meaning that the interface that you're probably use to with other phones (Samsung, Xperia, iPhone, whatever else) is different here. It's a lot simpler to use, and keep in mind if you don't like it, you can download something different from the Play Store.\n\nPhotos look excellent in my opinion (see my attached photo), navigating around the phone and apps works very quickly, and cell service (T-Mobile) has worked perfectly so far.

Name: 6, dtype: object","[""I've never spent more than $200 on average for a phone. I paid the price with suspect quality, since I mainly bought new Android phones for that price range. Every phone didn't last more than two years, most even started to have issues after a few months (i.e. GPS losing accuracy, charging slot losing contact, etc.) Of course the OS never gets updated so you set yourself up to be hacked on an old, unpatched release. The worst is the camera varying degrees of terrible. So I bought a prepaid iPhone 6 about 1.5 years ago but you know how well iOS runs on old hardware and it will probably not make the jump to the next update.\n\nNo matter how much I tried to convince myself, I just couldn't buy a new XR, even after I sold my DSLR (b/c I just never bring it with me no matter how good the pictures/lens is/was). However, when Google launched this phone, my last international family trip convinced me that I need to jump at the chance - pictures you have forever, you want the best camera/phone to capture your experiences. Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me.\n\nOrdering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time. I got it in 2 days after Google announced it. Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc. Phone powered right up. Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM. Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs. I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes.\n\nPhone is awesome. I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things. I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive. Most importantly, the camera is awesome. Photos are not blurry so far and super clear. I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options. I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it. Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.)\n\nIt seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable. However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges. I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself. The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping. Can't say it's worst, just different. The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years. I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that. The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers.\n\nVery pleased so far (will update if that changes). Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife. She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them.\n\nUpdate after 1 month\nBest phone I've ever had. Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc. I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time. I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures. Battery life is great. I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times. I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue. I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though...\n\n6 months update\nHere is my update on both my wife and my experience after almost 1/2 a year. So we both have Pixel 3a XL's. Overall, they have been awesome. Camera is awesome, no change. For anyone who just wants to point and click, there is no equal for the price (same as all the media articles). Battery life is great, no complaints. Size is great, especially for reading for those of us who need bigger fonts. So some issues. I had an issue that took a long time to resolve where I was not getting notifications of new voicemails left (using Sprint). Long story short after going to Sprint, working online with Google support, etc. the only way to fix it was to add an app called visual voicemail and sprint hub. This is counter intuitive but it took a huge amount of effort and troubleshooting to resolve. My wife, who had Best Buy setup the phone did not have any issue. She does however have data connection lost issues that is resolved by restarting and I have had it also but not as often. Essentially, the phone stops talking to the Internet. I'm going to try to reset the phone to resolve and then will escalate to Google if it doesn't resolve. Overall, still very pleased with the phones.\n\nAlmost 1 year update\nOh well, I had hoped the Pixel 3a would be rock solid. Over the course of a year it’s developed 2 major issues that require mention. One is it keeps losing data access. The fix is to turn network/airplane mode on/off so there is a quick fix but it’s annoying nonetheless. It happens about 30% of time, usually indoors or in a place that should have access but is maybe a bit difficult. I usually don’t notice it until I bring up a browser or e-mail and it says network unavailable. The other issue is worst. The call volume has become so low that people are unintelligible on calls with bad connections or on speaker phones with low volume. If you search Pixel 3a and can’t hear people you’ll find plenty of threads on their support site. I went through the whole support hurdles to get a replacement but what they do is send you to get it fixed at a contracted store. So the local shop spent over two hours replacing the speaker and I can say that it seems better but time will tell. I’ve never had a problem like this where the volume is so low that you can’t hear people. Some theories are it’s bad hardware others believe it was a bad software update. The repair shop said they’ve had many replace and for some the replacement works and for others it doesn’t. I’m knocking off a ton of stars because a phone shouldn’t die in the first year for any reason, certainly not a near flagship from a top tier manufacturer. I’ll watch it for the next month and if I still have issues I’ll insist on a replacement. My wife whom I also bought a 3a XL also has issues and she uses a headset to make it usable. The speaker phone doesn’t have this issue. Maybe Apple does know how to make phones that are good quality...but at 2x or 3x the cost?""]"

Name: 6, dtype: object","[""THIS RECIEW COVERS BOTH PROS N CONS OF THE PHONE.\nI scoured the internet in search of a device that is excellent and budget after losing my iPhone XR, and all of it points me to the Google Pixel 3a, so naturally, I bought it without hesitation and had high hopes with all the excellent reviews I saw.\n\nProblem #1 - Battery\nWhen I received the phone, I was really shocked at how quick the battery drained when I was setting it up ( I just downloaded a few apps and was using those few apps ) I received the phone in the afternoon with a charge of around 45% and the phone died at night, which really surprised me. I did some research and apparently I'm not the only one facing this issue. I don't know if its because I am comparing it to my previous experience on the iPhone XR ( lasts me 2 days with minimal usage) but the Pixel has a bigger battery capacity than the XR which would've meant it should last longer but that's not the case. I tried using the Pixel the same way I would with my XR but the results were disappointing. It feels like such a downgrade when I switched from the XR to the pixel (but it wouldn't be fair to compare a cad $800 phone to a cad $460 phone). I would say give it a whirl if you are a minimal user and don't mind bringing around a power bank. (This phone recharges quickly tho but who’s gonna bring around the charger all day)\n\nProblem #2- Performance\nThe phone is a little sluggish, the camera was a little slow. THERE IS NO PHOTO GALLERY, it takes you to Google Photos every time, which is uncomfortable and unorganized as my account is in sync with my other devices, and it requires wifi. you can download a photo gallery app separately tho. The default keyboard is Google Keyboard, which is fine if u like it but I personally didn't like it so I downloaded a different keyboard. I didn't really like the UI (User Interface) of the Google Andriod, as I find it a little odd, but that's personal, many people like it.\n\nProblem#3- Camera\nLike most reviews stating the weird tint of the camera. This is a phone that is highly praised on for having a good camera, but that's not the case with my experience, sure the camera works excellent in low light photos, and has a wide range, but.. The camera seems to have a filter over it, the colors in the pictures taken are brighter and darker than they are and made the pictures discolored\n(light green somehow turns to blue, light brown turns to dark brown, light blue turns to dark blue) it is nice when you are taking nature photos and want to emphasize on the colors, but it's frustrating when the pictures you took don't represent the actual color of the actual thing.\n\nPros:\nYou get the pure Google stock Android experience, you will enjoy it if you love andriod's customize ability and google as it has essentially all the google features such as google assistant (and google lens built in the camera) but google is offering the features on the app store too so those features isn’t exclusive to the Pixel.\n\nIn conclusion\nThis phone did not meet up with my expectation so I returned it as I would rather pay $250 more for a phone that performs well.\n\nStorage\n*also a side note if you are concerned about storage, the phone comes preloaded with 10+GB of system setting which can't be removed so you are essentially buying a 54GB phone.""]"

Name: 9, dtype: object","[""I am going to step you through each aspect of the phone and my thoughts so far.\n\nShort Version\n\nPro's\n- Price is seems very low for what you get.\n- Battery life is shockingly good. (ha)\n- Phone feels amazing in the hand, the one piece of aluminum shell can't be beat\n- Durability of this thing is on point, designed to last instead of break.\n- Speaker sounds great and achieves good volume.\n- Bare bones android, the dream.\n- Comprehensive antenna set for travel.\n\nCon's\n- No usb C connector, uses the more common micro usb.\n- Stock camera software is extremely basic, enough for most users but weak for those looking for those great shots.\n- Processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it's barely noticeable.\n- Phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection.\n- It doesn't make me breakfast.\n\nFeel and buttons: The phone feels extremely high quality, it's the only phone that I really hate having a case on because the aluminum feels so nice. The power and volume buttons are also aluminum and very solid, there have been complaints about them being hard to press, they aren't, they are just stiff enough that you won't easily accidentally press them like all other phones.\n\nTouch screen and fingerprint sensor: The screen felt a little off to me and it doesn't register touch perfectly but it's on par with other flag ship phones I've owned and I am still just getting use to it. The finger print sensor on this phone is amazing, it is covered with durable glass and reads finger prints very well. If you have issues with it re-enter your print, when I did it worked great.\n\nBattery: Holy crap, I've never, ever, had a phone that lasts like this one with the stock battery, my previous phone had an extended battery that more then doubled it's capacity and this phone doesn't drain much faster then it did. Charges reasonably quick and doesn't turn into a fire brick while charging and doing tasks.\n\nCamera: Ok, so my last phone had an amazing manual mode with full shudder speed controls and the works. This one comes with a stock android camera app that is pretty weak for features and merely ok at capturing good shots. Apps like open camera help resolve this but it's a little bit buggy on this phone, especially when trying to control shudder speed. I can't speak a lot to the selfie camera because I don't really use them.\n\nSpeaker: How does something this cheap have speakers this good? I don't have an answer, I'm just really happy it does. It's not super loud, it reaches about average volume, but does it with rich sound for a phone.\n\nSoftware: Stock android, no bloat other then the amazon apps but who isn't using prime? The ads are very easy to ignore and I'll gladly ignore an ad for 50 dollars, I honestly don't even notice them.\n\nAntenna's/Travel: One of the reasons I purchased this phone is because I am spending some time in Europe and it has, by far, the most comprehensive LTE antenna setup for the cost. I searched forever trying to find a phone with the 3,7,20 bands for Europe, I was struggling to find flag ship phones that had it and here it is on a entry level.\n\nDurability: The Youtuber JerryRigEverything said this may be his pick for most durable phone of 2017. I could have guessed that when it arrived. If you look closely at the phone you can see the spacer built between the screen and the outer edge of the phone, creating a bumper to help protect it. A thin rubber case is enough to make this phone very unlikely to be damaged. Even if you fall victim to the the very satisfying feel of this phone without a case you'd have to give it a pretty harsh drop to crack it.\n\nIf I think of anything else I'll edit the review later, if you have questions comment on this review and I'll try to address them. Finding the right phone to fit your situation can be tough but I believe this particular phone can fit nicely into most peoples situations.""]"

Name: 9, dtype: object","[""I have been watching this phone's development for awhile now, as I am a happy previous Nokia phone user. Every Nokia I've owned has taken my abuse and continued to work flawlessly. Obviously smartphones are different, but I had hoped that some of that resilience could rub off on Nokia's new foray into Android smartphones.\n\nThe build quality: This phone is machined and built to a much higher standard than any sub $400 phone on the market. It is solid, and feels great in hand, that is of course until I put a case on it. But its initial build quality does give me some confidence that it will handle day to day abuse without much issue.\n\nPerformance: I was a bit worried by the processor in this phone and had wished Nokia went with the Snapdragon 625 like their competitor, Motorola. Of course, the Moto 5g also didn't have 4GB of RAM, so it too was a tradeoff. So far though, after having installed my apps and put the phone under my own typical multitasking load, I am impressed by its overall responsiveness. It is not a speed demon by any means, but it doesn't hang or lag in any way that is frustrating. I can seamlessly go from streaming a podcast to surfing the web, watching netflix, mapmyrun, to using Google maps without a single hiccup. Fellow Android users, I'm sure you know when its time for you to reboot your phone because it starts to get laggy: I haven't had to reboot the phone since I got it. I'm not a super power user, but I do multitask on my phone, I just don't run power intensive games--would rather game on my PC or PS4. I think the fact that the phone runs stock Android also plays to the phones' relatively modest processor.\n\nBattery life seems to be very good on this phone. I can get 2 full days of usage if I'm a bit lean on using the screen. Can always get well over a full day with it even if my face is glued to it.\n\nCamera: Its fine for what it is. I use it mostly as a scanner for documents, or for random documentary shots. It is responsive and the image quality is OK. I personally don't really care, as I carry a dedicated camera with me that is significantly better than any smartphone could ever be.\n\nOverall, I think Nokia has a solid hit on their hands. The phone does everything I need it to do without frustrating me with heavy lag or glitches. And it does all this in an attractively designed body and a dirt cheap price tag.""]"

I'm not a heavy phone-user, so it exceeded my expectations by far!! It's fast, and I was able to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone quickly. So far, I have had no issues sending or receiving texts or phone calls. When I first turned the phone on, it went through upgrades and since I have had another upgrade. One thing I really love and was pleasantly surprised is there is something on the screen that keeps it from attracting fingerprints! I'm a bit OCD about fingerprints so I was constantly wiping down my last phone, but with the Nokia 6, I don't have to! I love it!""]"

Name: 9, dtype: object","['Disclaimer: I bought this phone after 5 years of using iPhones.\n\nThis Nokia is worthy of the brand name from a hardware perspective. It is very solid (has been dropped from pocket height too many times and is none the worse for wear), has great ""feel"" in the hand, and the screen seems much more scratch resistant than my previous iPhones - no micro-scratches at all after 4 months of use without a case and no screen protector (the phone only cost $300 - why waste money on a case). Most of all, I find it really great looking. Still after 4 months, when I look at it I think HMD Global did a great job of the design.\n\nThe software is almost pure Google Android, and is updated automatically to the latest. This is a good thing, compared to phones that come with poorly coded bloatware. The only Nokia software seems to be the Support app, which can be used to get live chat help from HMD Global. The phone is fast enough for normal daily use, though it does slow down after some time of not being rebooted, and so a restart once a week keeps it running fast as new, which is not great but is not a big deal either. Not sure if that is OS or phone firmware issues.\n\nFor me the negatives are the aspects Google brings to the table with the OS. To be clear, it is not ALL negative - the software is mostly fine. However, some very basics (in my mind) have been missed or poorly implemented by Google. For example, there is no separate control for notifications volume. It seems tied to the ring volume. For me phone ring (rare) and notification alerts sound (frequent) are not related at all. This means if you have dozens of apps, you get absurdly loud notification sounds if you have your ringer set to be loud enough to hear when the phone rings outdoors. The only answer is to go into each app one-by-one and turn off notifications, but that doesn\'t help for the core apps where I do want notifications - they are still too loud. Web forums are filled with such Android sound complaints, but no fix seems to be planned.\n\nAlso, things that should be simple are not well executed. Google\'s own apps such as Keep crash when switching between apps using the multi-task button. As well, the volume management in software is even more wonky, such as when I connect to a bluetooth speaker, the volume used for that device affects the overall volume of the phone even when not connected to the speaker any longer (speaker off) - example: after playing the speaker loudly, the minimum possible volume on the phone for music is very loud and has fewer ""steps"" between volume levels - i.e. the first ""step"" after zero (no volume) is already very loud.\n\nThere are several simple things in software that are surprisingly bad for an OS in version 8.1. The notifications volume control issue should\'ve been a version 1 or 2 feature.\n\nI would give the phone hardware a 5 star rating. The hardware quality for the price is really well done. The purchased device drops to 3 stars due to software issues that should\'ve been corrected years ago.\n\nApple is very smart not to license iOS. If iOS could run on this great $300 Nokia hardware, Apple\'s hardware division would be in trouble.']"

While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.\n\nThe only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not.

Name: 12, dtype: object","[""In order for me to do a complete review for this device I'd need to write a Trilogy! I will try to make this as brief as possible. First off, the display on this phone is breathtaking. Coming from a Galaxy S6 I never knew that a AMOLED display could outperform another AMOLED display. I also love that it's waterproof! I hesitated to use it in the rain since I've never had a waterproof phone before but now I don't even think about it. Next the camera was better than I imagined it would be. Zooming is incredible and I'm able to take high-speed photos without any distortion. 4K video is performs pretty much the same as my S6. It is nice that I can also plug my phone into a HDMI splitter and connect it to my TV. I haven't tried the DeX station yet but my S6 didn't support MHL so that's a nice addition. Call quality is pretty good. I love that this phone is Unlocked so it is not adhered to any one can. I have it on AT&T and believe it or not I do miss some of the functions from my S6. I would like to find out how to get their WiFi calling, Advanced Messaging, and VoLTE capability. Next, I did not think I would use the S Pen nearly as much as I do but there is so much you can do with it. Thank God I have legible handwriting or that fearure would be useless. However, my favorite thing to do is going into the PENUP app and doing some coloring. Suffice it to say the S Pen is amazing and you'll use it more than you think. Next thing that is amazing to use is the new Gear VR. It comes with a micro USB adapter so it's backwards compatible with my S6, if I really cared to use it. The last thing I'll talk about is how powerful this phone is. I thought having an Octa-Core processor and 3GB RAM in the S6 was amazing. With the Snapdragon 835 and 6GB this phone has no LAG! I'm not exaggerating either. So, if you want my opinion and you were really considering to get this phone GET IT!""]"

It has accidentally been dropped twice now with no effects. I like how everything appears to be nicely sealed up, all coverings are secure. I like that it can hold a SIM card and a SD card together. The camera works great even in low light. The flash doesn't appear to overcompensate. Front camera isn't too bad either. I like the Android 8.1 version. It's not loaded with bloatware but does include a few unique apps specific to the phone in the 'Toolbox'. This includes compass, bubble level, pic hanging, height meter, magnifier, & plumb Bob. I have not used these features as of yet.\nOne thing that's a little odd to me is the long screen aspect. It's 16:9. Nothing really bad, I'm just not use to it. Also, I have not used the fingerprint unlock feature so I'm not sure how well it really works.\nThe downside of this unlocked version is my data connection. I can only get 2G with my T-Mobile service. Apparently the frequency isn't the correct one for my area or something like that. My calls & text messages aren't affected, only the internet data. This is very frustrating for me as I am a high web surfer & use to my previous phone having the 4G connection. I use my WiFi when I'm at home bc it's faster. So do your research & check the frequencies for your carrier if you enjoy 4G. Otherwise, the phone itself is great for my needs but will probably be passed on to my teenage son when he's old enough for a phone. He definitely will need the rugged toughness of this phone.\nI will update as I continue to use it.""]"

The screen is not cutting edge but it is big, bright and clear with a high resolution it doesn't make me miss my AMOLED (except for the Always on feature). The battery is a beast and power consumption is good so far. The design is def rugged and I like it but it might not be for everyone.

I got a chance to see how this worked on Att/Cricket bands and I can say I got more bars of 4g than I ever did with my older Note phones. The phone is also the loudest phone I ever used. To a point where it didn't seem normal. I see some people had problems with their speakers. I wonder if its huge volume was causing those problems. I turned it down to a normal level and it works great. All the controls work precisely, so not an issue. Honestly, I would have never returned this phone and just kept it as a backup if it had a removable battery. Also, its not loaded with any crap apps and every app loaded is useful. Translator, Pedometer, and others. This in no way looks or feels like a budget phone and the bigger battery is great. You get a USA fast charger. The processor and ram were just right for this phone price and there's no lag doing browsing or running apps. I don't game much, but 3g of ram can get you by in many games.""]"

My primary phone is oneplus 6t and I found myself unable to use it during work as I was afraid to break it.\nBought this phone for a great price on Amazon, easily set it up using Google transfer and 30 minutes later I have a backup phone that I can torture at work.\nAs a new phone it is capable of doing everything my oneplus does and I really appreciate the extra tools that allow me to measure and align objects at work. Never thought about using these tools before.\nAlso installed on it my new favorite game, call of duty mobile and I'm playing on my breaks without issues.\nCan't wait until I can take it under water to test its camera.

Name: 21, dtype: object","['Bought this phone as a replacement to my LeEco Le Pro3, so I\'m no stranger to somewhat obscure but good value Chinese phones. This particular phone checked almost all the boxes I wanted in a new phone:\n\n*Large battery (4680mah)\n*Snappy CPU (MediaTek Helio G90T)\n*AMOLED / OLED screen\n*Relatively clean Android experience\n*Wide frequency / band support\n*Reasonable size\n*Minimal bezels\n\nThe only thing this phone truly lacks in my honest opinion is a headphone jack. Thats slightly disappointing but its becoming harder to find phones that can truly satisfy every checkbox. I will note that the phone is larger than my previous phone but still a usable size. It does feel noticeably heavier than my previous phone also, however, not necessarily in a bad way. Its not detracting or an obtrusive weight for me. The phone still fits fine in my jeans and work pants. My old phone was honestly too big to keep in my gym short pockets for a jog and this would be no different. You\'d want some kind of strap case if you were going to take it with you in those cases\n\nPackaging is fairly standard and simple. Charger, manual, USB-C to headphone jack dongle, sim eject tool, a case, and pre-applied screen protector. The phone is already inserted in the case out of the box also and with the case on it measures 6.42"" x 3.17"". The only area on the phone with buttons is on the right side where the volume up and down buttons are along with the power button. All 3 buttons are positioned exactly the same distance apart. It may have been better to position the power button a bit further apart from the volume buttons since I do find myself sometimes going to turn the screen on or off and hitting the volume down button by accident instead\n\nThe popup selfie camera is a neat trick and makes a little mechanical sound when it opens. I don\'t use the feature nearly enough to give a significant opinion about the cameras on the phone. But pictures I have taken with the rear facing cameras so far have been fine for my needs and the selfie came also takes decent pictures. The benefit of the camera is the front of the phone is almost entirely screen. It is also a great screen to view. Very vibrant and poppy. It may not be the highest pixel density in smartphones today but its certainly the best screen I\'ve ever had on a phone and browsing websites and watching videos is a very enjoyable experience. I will note that the phone does not use the earpiece as a second speaker for music or video, so all sound shoots from the single bottom firing speaker. It was a little odd initially, since my prior phone did use the earpiece to provide sound as well, however, I\'ve gotten used to it and the bottom firing speaker on this phone is louder than my prior phone\n\nThe software experience is practically stock Android 10 with the May 5th security patch level. I will mention that initially the phone comes setup so that all apps install to the main and side screens by default like iPhones, however, you can toggle that in the settings to have just a single home screen and all apps in the app draw instead. Very little or potentially no bloat installed, depending on how you look at it. Most of the apps are just the standard Google / Android apps: Messages, Calendar, Google Assistant, Files, Maps, Drive, Chrome, Duo, GMail, Google Play Movies & TV, YouTube, and YouTube Music. I personally disabled the last 8 in that list since I don\'t really use them but those are default apps on basically any new Android phone now. The only other notable apps that were pre-installed are DuraSpeed and Children Space. DuraSpeed is supposed to boost foreground app performance and Children Space seems to allow you to lock down the phone so that only a few apps are usable so you can hand it to a child for them to play with. I haven\'t uninstalled those or disabled them so far, however, I likely will never use them. There is an FM radio and app installed too, which is a nice feature, though I likely also won\'t use that feature much.\n\nThe phone is very snappy. I still don\'t think my prior phone is slow but this feels tangibly snappier. Apps open and close quickly and switching between screens is fast also. Background apps that you want to stay active do seem to hold in memory much better than my prior phone. I\'ve never noticed an app reloading so far when I switch to it in the Recents screen, though I admittedly tend to keep only basic apps open there anyway\n\nI know there was some info about the popup camera getting stuck with some specific actions. I never experienced that or tested for it, however, I did receive a software update on July 7th and one of the notes on it were that it addressed the popup camera freezing issue. On the topic of software updates, the phone may get small updates to address various glitches like that or improve some little features here and there, however, this will almost certainly never get an Android update. I knew that going in and right now its on the most recent version of Android so its not an issue. In the future, after a new release of Android comes out, and if I feel like I want any of those features, I will just root the phone and likely throw a custom ROM on it. Custom ROM support for MediaTek processors hasn\'t always been great, however, these processors are becoming more common and I\'ll likely be able to find something that will work with this phone without issue. In regards to the processor itself, I\'ve never felt the phone really even get warm so far during any of the tasks I\'ve used it for. There were times when my old phone would. The performance of this processor is just slightly below the Snapdragon 765G for comparison and I doubt there would be any tangible difference between the two, though the Snapdragon processor would have better custom ROM support, depending on the device\n\nBand support on this phone seems excellent and you could truly consider this a world phone. You likely wouldn\'t have issues using it anywhere for 2G, 3G, and 4G connections. The main issue with other Chinese brands is iffy band support in the US. I\'ve left a snapshot from Kimovil showing every major US carrier and how compatible with them this phone would be. You aren\'t going to have an issue using it with anyone here and this phone honestly has better support than most domestic and major brands as well. I\'m on Mint mobile (T-Mobiles network) and have had zero issues so far. Granted, the phone doesn\'t have 5G, however, I don\'t live in an area with that or where it would be implemented anytime in the near future, so its not a feature I need or miss. 4G is plenty fast for me to date and that isn\'t going anywhere anytime soon\n\nBattery life on this phone has been amazing so far. I\'m not the heaviest user in the world and my old phone actually had a decent sized 4070mah battery in it. However, that phone was a few years old and the battery life was declining. It would normally be at about 30%-to-40% by the end of the day and would be lower on heavier usage days. By comparison, this phone so far hasn\'t gotten below 85% by the end of my normal day and I don\'t need to charge it overnight. It has only lost about 2% to 5% overnight as well which was very impressive. The combination of the much bigger battery, the AMOLED screen, and a more efficient processor are all huge benefits of this over my prior phone. I doubt I\'ll ever have charging anxiety with this phone\n\nSo far I am wholly satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this phone to anyone. If you are in need of a new phone you should definitely consider trying this one out. For me its one of the best value for money phones on the market currently. I may update this review if I think of anything else or notice any particular issues']"

The screen is beautiful and vibrant. I like not having the notch/holepunch.\nI don't game on my phone, but it is very fast for my uses.\nIMO the camera(s) are perfectly adequate. Probably aren't Samsung flagship tier, but a huge upgrade from any phone camera I've used before.\nComes with a decent case (rubber, rough texture)\nDual SIM / SIM+microsd tray.\nSupports crazy number of wireless bands\nBootloader is unlockable in settings (have not tried this)\nHuge RAM and storage for the price\n\nCons:\nI'll also address some things that some people mention, but aren't a problem for me.\nPop up camera isn't super fast. It takes about 2 seconds to open once it starts moving. I personally never take selfies, so I don't ever intend on using it.\nSpeaker isn't amazing, but it's adequate. I personally use headphones always, so whatever. Also no headphone jack, but comes with a USB-C adapter.\nFingerprint sensor is optical (through the screen), and frankly is pretty bad compared to capacitive sensors. With my old Xiaomi phones, I was surprised when the fingerprint sensor didn't work. With this phone, I am surprised if it does work. It takes some practice. I hope there is some software tweak to make this better in the future.\nAMOLED support is a bit lacking. No out of the box ambient display. Granted this is something Android has chosen for some reason. I use a 3rd party always on app. Default setting is to wake the screen when you pick up the phone. There is also no option to wake on double tap (I really miss this). (My always on app lets me do this though)\n\nSoftware is a bit odd. Claims to run stock Android, but actually is a slightly modified ROM. Comes with no bloat, but has some modified system apps (different skin for clock/calc, etc). Lacks some system settings that I've come to expect.\n\nHardware: 9.5/10\nSoftware: 6.5/10\nOverall: 8/10\n\nWould definitely recommend if the cons don't bother you. Definitely possible that the software can be improved. All in all, amazing value for what you get.""]"

Name: 21, dtype: object","[""Once I saw the image of this phone, I immediately thought of the OP 8 Pro. The slide up camera, the size, the functions... even the colors. IT came to my impression that these flagship killer companies are starting to become more and more popular with their innovation and techniques to replicate real flagship phones with secondary hardware.\n\nThere are many pros to this phone. Here are my thoughts:\n\nPros:\n- Aesthetic. Super good looking, good weight and modern look to it. People who look at this phone from the outside will see a glamorous back that shines nice with reflection and gloss feel to it.\n- Great build quality. I'm not a huge phone enthusiast, but when I put it in my hand, it feels premium. Not as premium as you would say an iPhone or high-end Samsung or android, but premium to the point where it doesn't feel cheap and it's worth the money and above expectations.\n- Camera. Megapixels are good, but of course, too many megapixels will oversharpen the image and it won't be a great photo after all in the end if you use that high megapixel setting. Dynamic range is okay... I would rate it average. Portrait mode impressed me. Colors are decently good. But ya know... I'm not a huge camera nerd. So if you're looking for a phone that has decent picture quality and everything, I'd suggest you get this because I think this is an above average camera (for the non-camera nerds).\n- Battery life. Great battery life. This phone can last me a whole day or 2 (if i don't go on Reddit 24/7).\n- Case. The phone came with a nice rubber black case. I'm happy I got the black version because if I got the blueish teal version I wouldn't be able to see it. So it covers a good amount on the back.\n- Price. Flagship phones are over 1k nowadays. For $400, it packs a bunch of power and juice to make it useful for your daily needs.\n- FAST. I think this phone is pretty fast. No lag detection so far.\n\nCons:\n- I'd say if you want to have a camera that satisfies your nerdy needs, then don't get it. It has a lot of settings, but I don't think that it's right for you if you're really into photography and settings.\n- Motorized camera. Sometimes I think that the motor might wear out on me and break one day, but that day hasn't come yet so let's see what happens.\n- Big. If your hands are small, I do suggest you don't get this phone, because it's a little bit on the bigger side for a phone.\n\nOverall, great phone for a great price. I would suggest this to anyone who needs a phone for a cheap price and with beast specs. Will maybe update this review in a month. Cheers to everyone who reads this!""]"

This is way better, sounds amazing too.\n*The back cameras,. Wow.. I don't know how to describe, because I never have a phone with 4 cameras in the back and with that high quality, very high quality pictures, no compliant at all, just love it so much. And the wide angle and macro lens are fun.\n\nOverall this is a well made phone and worth the money with budget price loaded with all features and hardwares, the umidigi is using high quality hardwares , good stuff in their phone with very affordable price, very impressive of this brand umidigi, they did very good job to make good phone. Please keep up, I know where to get my next phone.\n\nCons, the only cons on this phone is, I cannot find much accessories, cases, screen, wallet cases for this phone.

It is IP68 waterproof standard compliant.\n\nThe screen is full HD and built over 6 inches in size. The touch screen quality is as good as my iPhone and the face ID and touch ID are as responsive.

Camera quality is superb for both front and back cameras. I would say that this is the ultimate travel phone or for the perfect poweruser. It's pretty much indestructible if your not deliberately trying to break it. Its rustproof, waterproof, drop proof, break proof! I got this for my brother because hes always playing MMORPG games on his phone and is always running out of battery at days end, with this phone's battery - its able to last him the entire day of mobile gaming!""]"

I turned it down to a normal level and it works great. All the controls work precisely, so not an issue. Honestly, I would have never returned this phone and just kept it as a backup if it had a removable battery. Also, its not loaded with any crap apps and every app loaded is useful. Translator, Pedometer, and others. This in no way looks or feels like a budget phone and the bigger battery is great. You get a USA fast charger.

Right out of the box Id NEVER consider using a phone without a case. This one feels like it already has a case based on how well made and rugged it is. It has a 4GB ram +32GBrom menory and you can put in an SD card to increase the memory to 128gb. It downloads apps and streams movies QUICKLY and runs really well. If you put in an sd card the phone takes you through a few easy steps to confirm installation which ""formats"" the memory card.\n\nThe phone has a rechargeable battery that is 8000mAh and it is hands down the best battery life Ive seen out of any phone or tablet Ive ever had. Despite me being on it literally all day it\'s never out of battery at the end of the day. It uses a type c charger and IS NOT QI enabled which is the only downside to this ohone in my opinion. It\'s IP68 Waterproof up to 30 min just make sure the silicone cocers are secure over the charging port and TF/SIM card slot. The camera is 12mp and it has a forward ans rear facing camera. It takes good pics and video but the auto focus is kind of funky sometimes and you have to tap the screen and mess with it a bit to get it to focus. It\'s slightly less effective then my name brand phone when it comes to focusing and there arent as many editing options (unless you download an editing app which isnt difficult to do).\n\nOverall this is an amazing phone for the value.

The battery won't last a full day if your a heavy multi tasker and power user I have killed the battery in 12 hrs. Plus if your trying to charge it while using it forget that idea. Doesn't work. To charge this thing you have to turn it off and let it charge for 24 hrs just to get 100% full battery. And don't even think about being able to use 2 sim cards and a SD card at the same time not going to happen as the photos show you can only have 1 sim installed an the SD card or you can have 2 Sims with no SD card. Yes it's heavy and weighs a ton compared to most phones. I will going back to Blu it another company and getting rid of this p.o.s. the processor is very slow my wife's of which only has a 1 gb processor runs faster than this. This is supposedly to be a 2 gb quad core processor with 4 gb running memory. It always says it has less than 1gb available. This is a boated over bragged about paperweight. I regret buying it. It's been nothing but a pain in the ass. The only way the battery last the way it says. Don't install any apps. Don't do anything but check your email and Facebook. Cause even the battery saver doesn't work. You can't turn it on when you want to. If you plug it in to charge it the battery saver turns off. And there is no way for you to turn it on.. another thing the battery percentage that is usually beside the battery so you can see just how much battery you have left. I added a photo zoomed in so you can see it. They put the percentage inside the battery and it's white so it's damn near invisible. Yes the phone feels like it has a solid case that's the only thing going for it in my book. The layout and look of the O.S. in it looks outdated and too simplfied. It doesn't allow you to make needed changes or adjustment that even cheap LG phones allow you to do the LG K51 is a thousands time a better phone if it had a solid case like what's wrapped around the wp5 and was unlocked.""]"

BUT SKIP OR DO NOT SIGN INTO GOOGLE EVER. Then open the google chrome browser (it\'s the only time you will need to use it) go to F-Droid.org (OPEN SOURCE SAFE APPS) download and install ""F-Droid. Google will be warning you it\'s not safe, nothing on your phone will work without google... Which is just NOT TRUE the phone works perfectly without google.\n\nOnce you have F-Droid installed search for these things: (When searching apps look at the last time it was updated)\n(As you add good open source apps - disable the default google app)\n1. Launcher (replaces the google start screen ""Quickstep"") I\'m using ""Bliss"" & ""Posidon""\n2. Keyboard (replace gboard no more google G) I\'m using ""Simple Keyboard""\n3. Calendar - I\'m using ""Simple Calendar""\n4. Clock - I\'m using ""Simple Clock"" (if it gets stuck on 24 hour, disable 24 hour and restart the phone)\n5 Contacts - I\'m using ""Simple Contacts""\n(I exported all my contacts to .vcf. Then imported them into Simple Contacts)\n6. Dialer ""Phone"" - I\'m using ""Simple Dialer"" (all the functions of ""Phone"" without google""\n(yes the ""simple apps are great)\n7. I installed ""Disabler"" (it can disable google things that will not let you disable them)\n8. I installed Duckduckgo Search (There are two a search to replace google search and a Duckduckgo browser)\n9. I installed Fennec F-Droid & Duckduckgo internet browsers to replace google chrome.\n10.

Win Win NO GOOGLE and longer battery life!\n\nThis is a great phone and it is strong I haven\'t done everything in the video. :)\nBut I have done these things to it already:\nFell out of my front pocket 5 or 6 times landing in muddy water twice, face down on concrete few times, into mud at least once (cleaned it in the sink). So I\'m loving that part of the phone!\n\nThe phone is very fast all the apps open very very quickly. It plays every video I have tried so far online or offline.\n(You can also install VLC Video and Music player, VLC remote server access via ""F-Droid"")\n\nPhone Spec\'s:\nWidth: 2 7/16\'s inches wide or about 73.66 mm.\nI like the width of the phone some are so wide they won\'t fit in my front pocket!\nThickness: 5/8 of an inch or about 17.7 mm.\nWeight: it\'s heavy lol almost 1 lb 0.8 lb\'s or about 0.43 kg\'s (The monster battery I\'m guessing)\nFlashlight: Super bright flashlight doesn\'t seem to drain the battery at all. I have left it on for over an hour.\nScreen: The resolution is 720X1440 not the highest but it still has a really nice screen with great graphic\'s to me.\nCamera/s: I don\'t do selfies :) but the rear camera is great default photo size 4160 x 3120 13.0 MP.\nFor me it takes great PICTURES if you want real PHOTOS use a CAMERA. :) You can resize, rename, edit in ""Simple Gallery""\nVideo: sorry I haven\'t used that and probably never will. I have friends & family that do FILM much better then VIDEO.\nSound: It\'s OK but at times a little low I don\'t have the best hearing in the world so I always have it on 100%. I\'m using a Bluetooth ear bud at home. (I disable Bluetooth when I\'m out and about). I haven\'t tried listening to music as my phone is mainly just a work tool.\nOnboard Storage: 32 gigs with all the downloads (new apps) which you can delete I still have 24 gigs free and the 2nd sim slot to add more if it\'s ever needed.\n\nI don\'t think I missed anything over all this is a great phone and for $149.00 which I paid it can\'t be beat.

A little cumbersome in the pocket.\n\nIt's very well built and can clearly take some abuse. I haven't submerged it yet but I live on the water and love the capability. I will update the review after more testing. It comes with a spare screen protector and has one already installed.\n\nThe dual SIM capability is very neat. I have both a Verizon SIM and a T-Mobile SIM in the phone (both from Ting), both are registered with no problems so far. Both cards were activated in different phones and switched to this one...this phone isn't supported by US carriers so your results may vary. The carriers aren't going to help you get it working if you can't figure it out, they'll just tell you it doesn't work and to buy their phones. But it does work.\n\nThe weakest thing I've found so far is the fingerprint reader, which is much smaller than other phones and in a weird place. I recorded my thumb twice (as two separate finger entries), which helped immensely. At first, it was unusable, but with this workaround, it now works 80-90% of the time.\n\nEverything works as advertised so far.

Name: 8, dtype: object","['Absolutely a FANTASTIC phone! I have been in need of a new rugged phone and was exploring my options when I ran across this one. This is a MAN’S phone, not for wimps! Read the reviews and watch the videos online of it being tortured and judge for yourself!\nIn real world use, it’s awesome. I was concerned hearing about some issues that some people were having with this phone and Verizon. I can tell you in my personal experience, no issues at all. Verizon is notorious for whitelisting very few phones, usually only those they have deals with to sell for a profit themselves. While this phone is not listed as “approved”, it works just fine on my existing account {NOT pre-paid). Look at the pictures and see for yourself.\nI have redacted any info from the pics to reveal personal info but you can clearly see the pictures are of an Armor 3W on Verizon’s network running 4G HD voice/data. I have tested it on both bands 4 and 13, no issues. It works flawlessly with my Verizon network extender in my home as well (extender only operates on band 13 by design).\nAndroid 9 (Pie) works as designed with no crazy carrier bloatware pre-installed. The battery lasts a LOOOONG time- I received the phone @ 96% charge right out of the box. I set it up and then ran it under normal use for 3 days before putting it on the charger still with 63% charge! The noise cancellation is phenomenal- I was in a basketball arena with thousands of screaming college students attending a hip-hop dance contest. It was so loud me and the person next to me had to yell to hear each other. I received a call and decided to see what happens. My client at the other end had no issues hearing me clearly!\nI am very impressed with this phone and highly recommend it to anyone. You pretty much can’t kill it and the price is unbeatable!']"

Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.\n\nThe only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not.

Name: 13, dtype: object","['Pros:\n–Unbeatable price following seller coupon coupled with a bank card incentive. This is my first experience with Umidigi phones and it has been positive. Clean looking OS out of the box, very little bloatware installed from vendors and certainly won’t miss all the game apps\n–Big consideration for me was this model supports a broad range of GSM 4G LTE bandwidths, including 66 and 71. Wanted to feel comfortable it would be fully compatible with Cricket Wireless and MetroPCS. Dual band 802.11ac wifi support is a bonus, many competitors only support single band b/g/n\n–Smoothly transferred existing nano SIM card from Nokia 3.1C activated on Cricket wireless, but did have to manually use blue tooth connection between phones to transfer the contact list, only one phone is NFC compatible. Now receiving constant 5 full signal bars inside my house where I never had more than 3 with the Nokia without walking outside. MicroSDXC card, SanDisk Extreme, 64GB, rated read 160/write 60, U3, V30, A2, formatted FAT32\n–The benefits of the AMOLED display will help offset Umidigi’s low 720x1548 pixel resolution, mine has vibrant colors, true blacks and good contrast. Much better display colors by adjusting: Settings/Accessibility/Color Correction. Turn it On.\n–Decided this purchase would be an unlocked phone because Android and carriers manipulate how we install and configure apps and add home screen widgets\n–4GB of RAM is sufficient for most users, this model with 128GB ROM is good for users who store many files (pics, videos, TMs) on their phones. Read professional reviews, 4GB is good, 6GB would be nice and is preferred by gamers, but draws down the battery charge sooner\n–Three rear cameras will offer more creativity with still pics but users are advised to experiment with the features before relying on the cameras for serious pictures\n–Professional reviews state this model is supposed to receive the Android 10 update, we’ll have to follow Umidigi to be certain they deliver on the marketing hype\n–This model supports wifi calling, NFC and fast cable but not wireless charging\n–Umidigi has released at least two software updates, in Oct and Nov, addressing expressed consumer complaints pertaining to fingerprint sensor issues. Still leery about fingerprint and facial recognition security, so will continue using lock screen patterns/codes\n--As of 02/29/2020 and six months of ownership, no serious issues or hiccups mentioned by others except keyboard touch sensitivity resulting in repeated characters\n\nCons:\n–Biggest annoyance so far is highly sensitive touch screen, difficult swiping with finger or stylus without accidentally highlighting areas you didn’t intend and numerous repeated letters when texting. Have not found internet solution to adjust keyboard sensitivity. After six months of use, have decided to remove another star due to the keystroke repeat and delay in release of Android 10 update.\n–Included user manual is very basic, Umidigi has not posted anything more substantial if there is one as of\n06/17/2020 Not documented anywhere but think I found solution to overly sensitive keyboard repeating keystrokes: Tinker with a few of these settings and you\'ll get the screen touch right for you: Tap App Info, back arrow left, scroll to bottom System, Language & Input, Gboard, Preferences. I turned OFF ""Haptic feedback on keypress"" and ""Popup on Keypress""; turned ON ""Long Press for Symbols"" and changed ""Key Long Press Delay"" to 110ms. These adjustments seem to be working for me and I might fine tune it more over time. Added a Star to review\n02/29/2020\n–Umidigi X is relatively new, few third party protective covers are available, that should improve. Always prefer and highly recommend using wallet folio cases for best protection against damage. Found one, seller shipped from China on same day as ordered, arrived in 10 days, perfect fit and reduces likelihood of activating side volume/power controls.\n05/13/2020\n--Grateful Umidigi just released a May 9, 2020 security and camera HDR enhancement update, arrived on my phone May 13. Still no sign of the Android X upgrade and we\'re getting closer to the Android 11 release this Fall.\n\nOther thoughts:\n–This model includes bluetooth v4.2, surprised so many phones in this price range still offer bluetooth v4.1, a real deal breaker. My Nokia has the latest v5.0\n--Would like to purchase the S3 Pro but hesitant due to what I\'m experiencing with model X. The newer S5 Pro is overly priced and the A7 Pro is puny with the P23 CPU.']"

The Umidigi X does have face recognition/unlock, but I personally like the fingerprint scanner.\n\nCamera: The Umidigi X phone's 48-megapixel three-camera setup and the 16-megapixel selfie camera is incredible. In my photos, I show how the camera on the Umidigi X can easily compete against other top smartphones.\n\nSpeed: The phone has stock Andriod 9 with no extra bloatware. It is fast and multi-tasks flawlessly. Opening and switching apps happen smoothly without lag. I don't game on any of my phones, but if you want to game on this phone, I am sure it will be able to handle basic and low graphic games.\n\nBattery: I have been using the Umidigi X phone for 48hrs now, and I can say, with its 4150mAh battery can easily last me all day, and yes, it outlasted my other phone.\n\n128GB Storage: Whenever I buy a new phone, 64GB is never enough, and 256GB is way too much storage for me, so I appreciate Umidigi defaults this phone to 128GB as I feel it is the perfect amount of room for most people. If 128GB is not enough for you, the phone has a MicroSD slot to expand storage.\n\nDesign: What can I say, the phone is beautiful! The flame design on the black glass and metal body looks fantastic. The only thing I wish Umidigi provided was a clear phone case instead of the included black case, so I can show off how amazing the phone looks. BTW, Yes, this phone has a 3.5 headphone jack and USB type-c fast charging.\n\nWould I recommend this phone?\nOf course, the Umidigi X is not going to be for everyone, especially for those who are already invested in another mobile ecosystem, but I say, Yes! I do recommend this phone. If you don't care about your texts appearing in blue bubbles, then I say save yourself seven hundred to one thousand dollars and get the Umidigi X.""]"

My favorite features are the new Samsung 48MP Camera, facial unlock, on screen fingerprint sensor, and super fast speed. In my opinion, Umidigi are of the best brands on the market today!

Name: 14, dtype: object","['Just got it a few hours ago, writing this review from my Galaxy 8 and will be returning the Xperia shortly. Honestly, it\'s not a bad phone but it\'s not a great one either.. and for the price I expected it to be a little better considering the competition in the same price range. Using it after having a s8 for 2 years felt like a downgrade especially the screen resolution and color saturation (LCD vs AMOLED). Also One UI just feels more intuitive and advanced, but that\'s my preference. Watching a video on this thing was really nice tho, the screen aspect ratio did make for a great viewing experience.\n\nCamera is not good. Telefoto 2x zoom was cool, but overall I expected alot more from a Sony camera considering they make great cameras. I know it\'s a mid-range phone but 4k video is one of the selling points of this phone.\n\nMy biggest disappointment was finding out that Sony does not even enable PS4 remote play on this phone. The only reason I even considered a Sony phone was to use it for remote play with my PS4 .. but I guess Sony only enables remote play for their ""flagship"" phones (i.e fork over $1,000 or you\'re S.O.L). That to me is just greed, as I see no reason they can\'t enable this feature for their mid-range phones. I get why they wouldn\'t allow other Android phones to do so (even though they allow iOS users to) but come on...\n\nAnyway will be returning this phone.']"

Name: 14, dtype: object","['Hello. I purchased this phone for my wife\'s birthday party. A note about shipping is after my review.\n\nI purchased this phone for my wife. Her previous phone was a Microsoft Lumia 950, pushing 3 years of usage. This was a very good upgrade from that phone.\n\nThe size difference was easily distinguishable and the first thing she noticed. The width is skinnier than the Lumia 950. The screen is also bigger, about an inch longer diagonally. She has small hands and it\'s perfect for her to grip with one hand and use. She\'s always used 2 hands for her smart phones so it\'s still a habit for her to use two hands with this, but I see her using one hand more often than before.\n\nNext, after turning on and setting up the phone, the next noticeable thing was the amount of apps available. On the Lumia 950 she had to go through a website or just not participate due to lack of apps in the Windows store, but now that hasn\'t been an issue. She\'s been able to download a bunch of apps that have been very useful (for example, the Walmart app allows for Walmart Pay and she used the app to pay for a transaction in-store when she forgot her credit card at home).\n\nLast, she loves the camera and massive screen. She casually takes photographs but really enjoys the 21:9 aspect ratio for taking wide photos. She uploads to Instagram to show her family and friends back at her hometown and the quality of the photos that came from the Xperia 10 have been great.\n\nFor me, I prefer something more mid-range (I have the Honor View 10 which IMO takes better quality photos and runs smoother) so I personally would rate this as ""good enough"" but for her, it greatly surpasses her basic needs and she loves the phone.\n\nQuick tip: she set up fingerprint unlock once for her thumb and it would misread her print a great deal, so I had her ""register"" another fingerprint when in actuality she just registered her thumb a second time and now it rarely misreads her fingerprint.\n\nFinally, a note about shipping: I preordered the phone on March 13 for my wife\'s birthday present, it released on March 18, and was marked as shipped on March 20. A week went by with no shipping updates so I called Amazon support and the representative said that it was stuck at the warehouse, so she would send another phone rush delivery and when the original phone arrives to send it back. The second phone arrived on March 28, a few days after my wife\'s birthday. I received the original phone in mid-April and sent it back.\n\n[EDIT] This phone gets one less star due to some apps just not working properly. I installed the McDonald\'s app and Nike SNKRS app and both won\'t properly connect, even though mine doesn\'t have any problems. It could be because her Google account is originally from another country that is now being used in the United States but I don\'t know. On her phone, the McDonald\'s app won\'t show daily deals and she cannot do mobile order, and the SNKRS app just keep saying there\'s an error when trying to log in.']"

Unfortunately, when I received the phone, there were two seals on the box; one was still sealed but it was covering an original seal that was already broken. I was concerned that I was actually getting a used phone rather than the ""New"" phone that was advertised on Amazon. Nevertheless, I opened it up and took it to the cell phone repair shop that was able to retrieve all the data from the old phone so they could transfer it to the new phone. When they attempted the transfer, they were not able to make it happen due to a faulty charge port. When they plugged the USB-C cable in, they had to back it out and wiggle it to get it to charge or accept data. They were not comfortable with the condition of the phone and asked me to get another one since they could not transfer the data successfully. I returned it to Amazon and just received a replacement today and guess what? Another broken original seal with a new seal taped over it.

Name: 2, dtype: object","['I have used a Huawei for the last 4-5 years and found it to be the best smart phone I ever had. So I decided to upgrade to the P30, with the Android 9 operating system. Package arrived and I read the small multi language instruction sheet and finally realized that I had been provided a small specialized pin to make the SIM card carrier eject. When the carrier came out it looked fragile and easily damaged and possibly able to be inserted upside down. I did not like the fact that a small specialized pin was required to eject the carrier. It is easily lost and since I frequently change SIM cards when traveling internationally it is one more unnecessary item to carry and lose. So I tried to get my Consumer Cellular SIM card to ride in the carrier in every possible position and it just would not fit. I read the instructions and it said not to use a SIM card that was cut or modified, mine was not either, it was an original equipment SIM card in my previous Huawei purchased from Consumer Cellular. So before damaging anything and realizing that what starts off bad generally goes from bad to worse, I packed the P30 back up and sent it back for a refund. I just wish I could find a Huawei with the features that I need that would accept my SIM card in a convenient location and manner and have the new Android operating system. I think it would have been a good phone with everything and more than I wanted but if the SIM card does not fit, and cannot be easily changed out without an easily lost specialized pin, it is not the phone for me..']"

If I have an issue I can just buy the latest model in Amazon and have it the next day. BTW right now I have 4 functional BLU phones. My latest was a Vivo XI+ which I love. But the battery was not lasting a whole day, so I decided to buy the latest. I considered buying the G90 Pro, but I decided to try the G90 instead. I had i for one day and I am happy.\nThe iridescent blue back is cool, but it\'s a pity that you don\'t get to see it once you put it inside the case. I am used to the thin cases that came with the BLU phon9, so I was surprised to find out that this one comes with a really rugged case! It has thick protective corners and the volume and power buttons are raised so they are easy to find.\nMy Vivo is 6.2"" and this is 6.5"", which annoyed me at first, when I saw how much bigger it is in reality. It takes more room in my pocket. But shortly I got used to it. Because of the case, it won\'t slip easily out of your pocket. And there is so much more room on the screen so now I can fit many more ap icons on each screen!\nIt comes with Android 10. I haven\'t figured out all its new features but I have found the Dark Theme, where aps that support it have a black background. I love it! It should also help prolong battery life.\nEverybody complements the pictures that I take with my BLU phone, so I am eager to check this camera out. It has 3 lenses and I read that it has a wide angle mode, but I have not found it. Perhaps only in the Pro version?\nSo up to now the only issue that I have with this phone is that there is no documentation on how to use the advanced features of the camera!\n\nI will edit this review after I have the phone longer time.\n\nI figured that the wide angle turns on and off with icon of a circle with an angle inside.\nThe Intelligent Scanning reads QR codes to take you to a web page.

I was out landscaping in my yard today, laid my phone down on a chair, and I easily heard my 80\'s music crisp and clear; did not need a Bluetooth speaker (even though that would make it much louder as we know). Headphone jack is an added feature. Camera is very nice! High quality pictures! Quality zoom focus and clear and colorful pictures (I have a few examples). A little cool feature is you can place 3 fingers on the face of your phone and screen shot. This is great since I screen shot a lot. When navigating through the phone, the processor is very fast and smooth experience. With all of these positives, then an extra bonus is the unique stylus tucked away perfectly. Writes very smooth and easily and is just plain fun! I\'m a teacher, so very nice to have a note taking device when I quickly need it without frantically looking for a pen or pencil and paper. Just convenient to have in grocery store or when a quick idea comes to mind. Using screen protectors does NOT effect the stylus at all either. The battery life is Great out of my own Rating: Exceptional/Great/Good/Poor. Even though it\'s not exceptional, the phone charges fast, so no big deal in my opinion. I will never understand why people waste their money on a phone with a battery ""on steroids"" that lasts 2 or 3 days and pay an arm and a leg for it especially when you charge it up every night anyway. Also, amazing storage!\n\nNote: At first, I thought this phone didn\'t have the capability to change the volume on notifications or texts. Well, it does. The side buttons are of course for sound, vibration, or silent like most phones and are used for Media Sound for FB, YouTube videos, calls, etc. You have to go to SOUND in Settings and use the Ring Volume to control the notifications or texts sounds. There\'s also a Call Volume and an Alarm Volume in this same SOUND Setting. I hope this helps.\n\nFor $299, I\'m shocked this stylus and phone is so solid. Highly recommend this phone!\n\nThe only negatives or cons is that it doesn\'t have wireless charging but not a deal breaker for me. Also, I wish it had a notification blinking light to notify me when I have a message but not a deal breaker once again.']"

Name: 6, dtype: object","[""Pros: Call quality is great on Verizon. Opening websites, Google images is actually faster than some of more expensive phones I've tried before! Action camera takes rather decent videos. In right lighting, photos come out crisp. Stylus is useful in taking quick notes. Dual speakers and headphone jack are great fratures to have and keep.\n\nCons: battery life for a 4000 mah phone is rather disappointing even for first day use. Roughly 5 hours of screen on time. Moto display, where you wave your hand to turn on screen is absent. This was one useful feature from Moto. Instead you get one tap checking. Last but not least is pure Android issue. Many Android phones allow you to control notification volume separately. Unfortunately, Moto follows Google Pixel's pure form and removes this feature. You'll have to silence ringer or media volume to silence your texts which seems like a huge step backwards.\n\nConclusion: overall, this is a solid device for its price. With only a battery letdown being a clear issue, the G Stylus can be a great daily device for anyone who doesn't wanna spend $500-$1000+ on a phone.""]"

Name: 6, dtype: object","[""The phone itself is amazing for the price. I use a galaxy s10 for work but needed to replace my old s8 that I had been using for personal use. I didn't want to shell out over $1000 for a flagship and picked this up when I saw it for $299. Overall the phone is snappy and I don't have any complaints comparing it to my other phone. The screen is noticibly worse especially around the camera cutout where you can see some hazyness but that's to be expected for $700 cheaper. It performs fairly nice in casual games and you won't have any issues scrolling through your news feed.\nThe reason I give it 3 stars has to do with the service. I'm on the same network as before calling the same people so I am sure it's the phone. I can not have a call go longer than 20/30 minutes without the call just randomly dropping. My husband is in the military and gone for the moment so I end up making a ton more phone calls than the average person. We are usually on the phone 3+ hours every single day. To make matters worse there is no audible noise when a call is ended making it even more frustrating. You could be explaining something and you look up and they've missed everything you said.\nIf you only text or use groupme and social media this phone does the job great. But phones are calling devices for me and I honestly can't recommend one that has this many service issues.""]"

Name: 8, dtype: object","[""Preso in sostituzione ad un Huawei Mate 10 Pro, che funziona ancora benissimo, ma dopo 2 anni volevo qualcosa in piu'. Cosa ho ottenuto in piu' con il Poco F2 Pro? Sicuramente molto meno di quanto mi aspettassi.\n\nEro consapevole che con questo smartphone avrei dovuto rinunciare a qualcosa, accettare dei compromessi , e' un prodotto indirizzato ad un utente che ricerca la velocita', la potenza e un buon uso nel gaming. Ma non mi aspettavo di riscontrare tutte queste mancanze rispetto al mio precedente telefono uscito 3 anni fa. Andro' a raccontare gli aspetti negativi che ho riscontrato in una settimana di utilizzo rispetto al mio precedente smartphone partendo dai meno ai piu' gravi. Preciso anche che appena arrivato il telefono l'ho aggiornato alla MIUI 12 e ho fatto un hard reset prima di iniziare ad utilizzarlo.\n\nA livello fotocamera siamo a livelli un po' bassini, specialmente in situazioni di scarsa luce, ma va bene cosi, come gia' detto si punta alla velocita' e per averlo a questo prezzo ovviamente ci sono rinunce da fare.\n\nAndiamo avanti... Abbiamo notato subito, sia io che gli amici che chiamo di solito, un notevole abbassamento della qualita' audio in chiamata, sia in entra che in uscita rispetto al Mate 10 Pro, sia a livello di volumi che proprio di chiarezza dell'audio. Questa cosa non mi e' piaciuta proprio per niente.\n\nContinuiamo con vari bug riscontrati durante l'utilizzo: link da whatsapp che a volte non si aprono e bisogna riavviare l'app, schermo che a volte non si riattiva allontanandolo dall'orecchio e quindi impossibilita' a chiudere una chiamata. Audio in cuffia che durante i giochi ogni tanto si impalla e non funziona ne in entrata e ne in uscita e chissa' quanti altri bug avro' il dispiacere di scoprire.\n\nSensore di impronta digitale sotto lo schermo che funziona davvero male, ho dovuto registrare 3 volte la stessa impronta per avere piu' possibilita' che venga riconosciuta, e bene o male adesso il piu' delle volte viene riconosciuta. Ma registrandola una sola volta (come dovrebbe essere) la riconosce solo la meta' delle volte quando va bene. Si capisce che e' un problema del telefono dato che anche durante la registrazione dell'impronta, molto spesso fallisce e non si riesce a registrarla e bisogna rifare tutto da capo. Inoltre anche quando la riconosce non e' molto veloce lo sblocco. Specifico anche che ho lasciato la sua pellicola preinstallata.\n\nMa paradossalmente la cosa che veramente mi sta deludendo, e' proprio la velocita' dello smartphone in termini di reattivita'. E' molto meno reattivo di quanto dovrebbe, a volte meno reattivo del Mate 10 Pro, per assurdo ho avuto per un po' di tempo un Redmi Note 8 Pro e notavo molto di piu' la miglior reattivita' del Note 8 Pro rispetto al Mate 10 Pro, mentre la avverto di meno tra Poco F2 Pro e Mate 10 Pro Come e' possibile? Chiariamo pero', il processore e' il migliore sul mercato, le memoria e' una UFS 3.1, dove c'e' da dare potenza la da benissimo, nei giochi si comporta bene, li apre velocemente, non lagga, e' fluido. Ma per assurdo a volte lagga durante l'utilizzo leggero, anche spostandosi nel sistema, le app leggere a volte si aprono con un po' di ritardo, la velocita' dell'apertura della tastiera idem. Il problema quindi non sta nella potenza, ma proprio nel quanto ci mette a dare potenza, sembra che abbia dei colpi di sonno, si prende sempre un attimo prima di scatenare la sua forza e la cosa a volte e' un po' irritante. E' come navigare con una fibra ma con ping altissimo, non so se rendo l'idea. E' un problema di tempi di risposta, ma poi quando risponde spinge bene sull'accelleratore. Penso e spero che sia tutto dovuto ad una scarsa ottimizzazione del sistema e spero che riescano a farlo girare come si deve in tempi brevi nei prossimi aggiornamenti.\n\nAltra cosa che ho notato e' che il sistema di protezione della camera pop-up, quello che prevede la chiusura di quest ultima in caso di caduta, non funziona proprio bene. Se tipo simulo un lancio o se lo lancio leggermente in alto, allora la camera si chiude. Se lo lascio cadere sul letto da piccole altezze, si chiude solo dopo l'impatto. Non mi ha dato particolare sicurezza ma non ho voluto rischiare troppo la sorte per avere certezze. Ma non mi ha convinto troppo.\n\nVogliamo parlarne solo male di questo Poco F2 Pro? No, nonostante tutto non l'ho reso ancora e ci saranno dei motivi. Come gia detto, e' potente anche se non reattivo quanto mi aspettassi nell'uso generale. Ottima dissipazione, non scalda mai nemmeno giocando per ore a giochi abbastanza pesanti come PUBG, cosa che non posso dire ne per il Mate 10 Pro, ne per il Redmi Note 8 Pro, quelli scaldano abbastanza in quei contesti. L'unica situazione in cui scalda abbastanza e' durante la ricarica.\n\nL'autonomia sembra abbastanza buona, ma non ho potuto testarla ancora bene, dato che sto giocando tutti i giorni per qualche ora e per questo mi tocca ricaricarlo anche 2 volte al giorno. Ma e' abbastanza normale con certi giochi si consuma molta batteria, posso dire che regge sicuramente piu del Mate, anche se non di molto. Ma sono abbastanza certo che si riesca ad arrivare a sera senza doversi preoccupare eccessivamente di risparmiare batteria.\n\nBel display anche se inizialmente confrontandolo sempre al Mate, ero rimasto un po deluso perche i colori erano piu' spenti e a me piacciono i colori accesi. Ma sbirciando nelle impostazioni del display ho cambiato i colori dall opzione ''automatica'' all'opzione ''intenso'' e i colori si sono ravvivati a dovere. Quindi se non vi convincono i colori, modificate le impostazioni. Simpatica la funzionalita' Clone della fotocamera, sono pochissimi attualmente gli smartphone che possono utilizzarla.\nLa cassa e' piuttosto forte anche se purtroppo e' mono e l'audio ,al di la' del buon volume, qualitativamente e' piuttosto scarso.\n\nE' grande si, ma mi aspettavo fosse meno maneggevole, invece si tiene abbastanza bene in mano, non l'ho trovato scomodo come temevo.\n\nInteressante anche il cassetto delle app che permette di ordinare le app per categoria, tra l'altro abbastanza personalizzabile con possibilita' di creare delle categorie da rinominare come si vuole e addirittura ricercare le app per colore. Utile se si hanno tante app, ne cerchi una di cui non ricordi il nome ma ricordi il colore dell'icona, ti permette di vedere tutte le app di quel colore e quindi trovarla piu' facilmente. Ovviamente e' inevitabile che non sia precisissimo dato che alcune icone sono di piu' colori e quindi tende solitamente a rilevare il colore che prevale, ma quando non ci sono colori che prevalgono sceglie un po' a caso in quale gruppo di colori inserirlo, ma in linea di massima le raggruppa bene.\n\nAltra cosa apprezzata (in parte) e' la cover rigida contenuta in confezione, protegge molto meglio delle solite cover in silicone che si trovano nelle confezioni dei Redmi che proteggono solo da graffi, mentre questa anche da cadute (piu o meno). Ma non e' perfetta, il difetto piu importante di questa cover e' che se messa su un piano liscio, scivola da paura. Se si urta per sbaglio, il telefono parte a 100 Km/h con alto rischio che cada dalla tavola, o da qualsiasi altro ripiano liscio. Mi e' successo gia' 2 volte e' l'ho salvato in calcio d'angolo. Altro aspetto negativo e' che non protegge quasi per niente la fotocamera, non sporge, ma allo stesso tempo non e' protetta da un eventuale caduta dato che rimane a filo con la cover.\n\nSono felice dell'acquisto? mah... Indubbiamente molto meno di quanto mi aspettassi come avrete capito, un po' troppe rinunce secondo me, un po' troppo squilibrato, e' tutta potenza ma nemmeno ottimizzata bene da renderlo sempre fluido in tutto. Ma intanto non ci sono molte alternative sul mercato per avere a questo prezzo uno Snapdragon 865. Non sono ancora certo al 100% di tenerlo, ho il processore piu forte attualmente sul mercato certo, ma rinuncio a tante cose che sono migliori sul Mate (audio, no lag, no bug, fotocamera, dimensioni e peso, lettore impronta). Forse sbaglio io a confrontarlo con un Huawei Mate 10 Pro? Top di gamma si, ma di 3 anni fa, che ho acquistato (dopo 1 anno dall'uscita, quindi due anni fa) ad un prezzo molto inferiore di quello attuale del Poco F2 Pro (409 euro). Non so, credo che su questa fascia di prezzo, tenendo conto che e' uno Xiaomi (quindi qualita'/prezzo ecc. ecc.), avrei dovuto avere qualcosa fra le mani di NETTAMENTE superiore, ma qui al di la del processore (nemmeno valorizzato bene dal sistema) e della buona dissipazione, ho trovato quasi tutto peggio.\n\nIn questo momento non so se lo consiglierei, dipende molto da che smartphone venite. Chiaramente se venite da smartphone piuttosto economici, questo vi sembrera' una bomba, vi sembrera' tutto fantastico e la soddisfazione personale e' quella che conta. Non si puo' sentire la mancanza di qualcosa che non si ha mai avuto e si vedranno solo i lati positivi. Se invece venite da smartphone gia' abbastanza performanti e' ovviamente piu' facile restare delusi. C'e' da dire pero' che il prezzo sta scendendo molto velocemente, da qualche parte si trova gia a 350 se non vi interessa la garanzia amazon e scendera' probabilemente abbastanza di prezzo anche qui su amazon entro un mese o due. Intanto il telefono avra' aggiornamenti e migliorera' e a quel punto ne varra' molto di piu' la pena. Spero di essere stato utile.\n\nAggiornamento:\nHo ripreso a lavorare e quindi lo sto usando tutto il giorno fuori casa e ho riscontrato un altro paio di problemi. Fatico ad arrivare a sera utilizzando un paio d'ore il navigatore, poche foto e qualche chiamata breve. Sono costretto ad abbassare la luminosita' dello schermo per arrivare a sera, cosa che non sopporto.\nMa la cosa piu' grave e' che ieri, durante il lavoro il telefono si e' surriscaldato tantissimo, quasi incandescente, fino a che e' spuntata una scritta che avvisava del surriscaldamento del telefono e non permettendomi utilizzare gran parte delle funzioni. Ho dovuto spegnerlo per un po' e farlo raffreddare. Non e' chiaro a cosa fosse dovuto il surriscaldamento, faceva caldo si, ma non eccessivamente, ma soprattutto il telefono era in tasca e non lo stavo utilizzando da un po'. Prima volta che mi capita uno smartphone con un surriscaldamento cosi' forte e cosi' ingiustificato. Strano perche' come avevo gia' detto, durante l'uso, anche in gaming, le temperature rimangono basse e tenendo conto che e' anche estate, ne ero rimasto positivamente colpito. Ma a quanto pare non riesce a reggere le temperature esterne, oppure potrebbe essere dovuto a problemi software che portano a spingere il telefono anche in standby e cosi si spiegherebbe anche il consumo eccessivo di batteria. Intanto ho disattivato l'always on display, vedremo se cambia qualcosa. Ma credo ci sia qualche problema di fondo nel software.\n\nAggiornamento 2:\nIncacchiato nero, dopo un mese e mezzo il telefono non carica piu' e mi ha incasinato e fatto perdere giorni di lavoro. Provato anche altri caricabatterie e cavi e non rileva nemmeno le cuffie usb-c, la porta usb-c e' morta cosi all'improvviso. Che delusione...""]"

Weil ich kein Fan von langen Rezessionen bin fasse ich mich kurz.\n\n1. Das Display wird auf einer bekannte Webseite für China Handys als deutlich heller beworben als es letztlich ist ( bis zu 1300 Lux). Der Hersteller gibt die Helligkeit mit 500 Nits ohne Helligkeitssensor und bis zu 800 Nits mit Sensor an. Diese Werte halte ich für realistisch. Mit zugeschaltetem Sensor kann sich die Helligkeit durchaus mit einem Huawei Mate 9 (Zirka 670 Nits) messen.\n\n2. Die Kamera macht gestochen scharfe Bilder und liefert auch bei schwachem Licht im Nachtmodus tolle Aufnahmen. Leider sind die Aufnahmen für meinen Geschmack viel zu blaustichig (siehe Bilder). Ob das an einer fehlerhaften Einstellung lag oder die Software das so berechnet kann ich nicht mit Sicherheit sagen. Mein uraltes Huawei Mate 9 (Baujahr 2017) bleibt mit seinen Aufnahmen viel näher am Original.\n\n3.

Name: 10, dtype: object","[""I bought this phone because I wasn't willing to spend a grand on the S20/ or note. Plus on Amazon it saved me an extra 100. I have tmobile. And I switched my sim out from my S9. Phone calls and texting worked immediately but it took me a couple hours to get the mobile data running. But after I restarted the network I am now on 5G.\nI did not receive my headset. I reached out to Amazon and I'll see what they say. If not I'll reach out to Samsung. This phone is larger than my S9 but I love the screen size even though it's not easy to hold for me with one hand. It is a beautiful phone. Screen has amazing color. And it is quite fast. Downer is the battery life. I've been on it for a couple hours and I'm down to 62% but it did charge really fast. From what I did see of the camera in low light the picture did come out nice for being at night. 3 different settings are on upon opening it. Zoom back, regular and zoom in. I'll see what the pictures look like in the day. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. Just hope that the battery life gets fixed. It's a nice alternative for getting a new phone at a not so large price tag.""]"

Name: 10, dtype: object","[""This phone is a lot better than expected. Coming from the s10+, I was worried that I would be completely disappointed. The s20fe feels premium despite having a plastic back. This is due to its thickness and weight. The plastic feels premium and the cloud mint doesn't leave visible fingerprints. The phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865; the phone feels very smooth. The 120hz refresh rate also adds to the smoothness of the experience. 6gb of ram is sufficient for the vast majority of users. My s10+ plus had 8gb and I felt like I could have an endless amount of apps open. The same could be said with this phone. The cameras are quite good but I'd recommend testing out the phone in person. Yes... the 1080p display looks fine. You will not be able to tell the difference unless you get a magnifying glass or put your eye right up to the display. If you are coming from the s8 or and older phone, this phone is worth picking up.""]"

Name: 10, dtype: object","[""When I purchased this it was listed as 8gb of ram but the model I received is 6gb. That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.\n\nThe phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.\n\nDoesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.\n\nI'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5.""]"

Name: 10, dtype: object","[""Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.\n\nThe only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.""]"

Name: 11, dtype: object","[""Finally I found the perfect case that fits my Moto g stylus perfectly!! It feels smooth but is not at all slippery either in my hand or if I set it down on any surface. It has side gripper so it doesn't slip in your hands either. The clear cover shows the blue color on the back of my phone which I find attractive. This thin cover is beveled around the camera lens but protects lens too. Usually I have found that most covers make the volume and on off harder to push and use controls. Not this phone! The buttons tap easily for volume and on/off.i purchased 4 other different covers and didn't like any of them. So glad I didn't give. Your phone is in your hands so much that it's important to have a good one.\nI'd buy another one in a heartbeat!""]"
